abstract = {Intermetallic titanium aluminides are often alloyed with niobium to improve oxidation resistance and mechanical properties. Depending on the overall alloy composition and on the solubility of the present phases for niobium, new phases may be introduced in the alloys' microstructure upon niobium addition. Here we describe the microstructure of the alloy Ti-42Al-8.5Nb produced by powder metallurgy after annealing at 550 °C and 650 °C. We identify the orthorhombic O-phase within $\alpha$2 laths of lamellar ($\alpha$2 + $\gamma$) colonies by single crystal electron diffraction and high-resolution imaging. Domains of O-phase variants and $\alpha$2 phase form columnar crystallites in $\alpha$2 (0001) planes having low indexed $\alpha$2 {\{}11-20{\}} and {\{}1-100{\}} interface planes. The nm-sized domains are rotated with respect to each other resulting in elastic strains across the domain boundaries. No elemental segregation of Nb was detected in $\alpha$2/O-phase lamellae.},

abstract = {This research is dedicated to the experimental investigation of the residual stress relaxation in girth-welded pipes due to quasi-static bending loads. Ferritic-pearlitic steel pipes are welded with two passes, resulting in a characteristic residual stress state with high tensile residual stresses at the weld root. Four-point bending is applied to generate axial load stress causing changes in the residual stress state. These are determined both on the outer and inner surfaces of the pipes, as well as in the pipe wall, using X-ray and neutron diffraction. Focusing on the effect of tensile load stress, it is revealed that not only the tensile residual stresses are reduced due to exceeding the yield stress, but also the compressive residual stresses for equilibrium reasons. Furthermore, residual stress relaxation occurs both parallel and perpendicular to the applied load stress.},

@article{Elkhateeb2018,
abstract = {In this paper, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is used to simulate the crack propagation along the interface of Ti6Al4V/TiC in Titanium metal matrix composites under Mode-I and II loadings and at different temperatures. MD simulation can then determine the interfacial traction-separation relationship between Ti6Al4V and TiC. The interatomic potential between the atoms in Ti6Al4V/TiC composite is defined by the second-nearest neighborhood modified embedded atom method (2NN MEAM) and the Morse potential. For Vanadium-Carbon (V-C) interatomic potential, the 2NN MEAM parameters are developed and validated based on previous first principle calculations conducted on VC structure. MD simulation results show asymmetrical crack propagation along the interface between Ti6Al4V/TiC and the crack propagates in Ti6Al4V than along the interface. The obtained traction-separation relationship is used to parametrize the cohesive zone model (CZM) for modeling the interface in finite element analysis. Validation of the parameterized relationship is done by finite element simulation of the compression test of Ti6Al4V/TiC at different volume fractions of TiC. A good agreement is shown between the stress-strain results obtained from simulation and the experimental data under the same conditions.},

abstract = {Dislocation nucleation is essential to the plastic deformation of small-volume crystalline solids. The free surface may act as an effective source of dislocations to initiate and sustain plastic flow, in conjunction with bulk sources. Here, we develop an atomistic modeling framework to address the probabilistic nature of surface dislocation nucleation. We show the activation volume associated with surface dislocation nucleation is characteristically in the range of 1-10b3, where b is the Burgers vector. Such small activation volume leads to sensitive temperature and strain-rate dependence of the nucleation stress, providing an upper bound to the size-strength relation in nanopillar compression experiments.},

abstract = {An in situ study of twinning in a TiAl alloy has been performed in order to determine twin properties and to discuss the processes controlling twin propagation. This study shows that twinning is due to a/6[112] partial dislocations gliding in octahedral planes and that twinning is an intensive mode of deformation for some specimen orientations. Twins move slowly at an approximately constant velocity by a collective movement of partial dislocations which are separated by a constant distance during the motion. Twins in the TiAl alloy are perfect. A polar twin source is analysed. The occurrence of twinning with respect to other possible deformation modes is discussed and interpreted using the Schmid law. It is shown that the twin propagation is controlled by thermally activated frictional forces acting on partial dislocations and by the dragging of a stacking fault.},

abstract = {Intermetallic titanium aluminide alloys based on the ordered face-centred tetragonal $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase represent a good example how fundamental and applied research along with industrial development can lead to a new and innovative class of advanced engineering materials. After almost three decades of intensive R{\&}D activities $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys have matured from "laboratory curiosities" to novel structural light-weight materials which eventually found their applications in aerospace and automotive industries. Their advantage is mainly seen in low density (3.9-4.2 g/cm3), high specific yield strength and stiffness, good oxidation and ignition resistance, combined with good creep properties up to high temperatures. Particularly at temperatures between 600 °C and 800 °C $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys are superior to Ti-based alloys in terms of their specific strength. Compared to the heavier Ni-based alloys below 800 °C, their specific yield strength is at least similar. Therefore, the particular constitution and extremely fine microstructure of these alloys are illustrated by several high-resolution transmission electron micrographs. The mechanical properties seem to be largely affected by the evolution of internal stresses and off-stoichiometric deviations of the majority $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase. Novel experimental approaches are described that could characterize the relevant deformation mechanisms. The combination of these results with the concepts of continuum mechanics and continuum thermodynamics has allowed developing models to describe thermomechanically controlled processes. A selection of such models is introduced and explained in a comprehensive way. While early modeling attempts were successfully undertaken to elucidate selected aspects of physical metallurgy of Ti-Al alloys, many experimental findings, particularly for modern multi-phase alloys based on $\gamma$(TiAl) with rather complex constitution and microstructure are still waiting for explanation.},

abstract = {The stress-induced phase-transition $\gamma$-TiAl ↔ $\alpha$2-Ti3Al in TiAl alloys was systemically studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that the key role in such phase-transition is the alloy composition. Firstly through studying the relationship between the formation energy, structure (fct and hcp) and alloy composition (Ti:Al = 1-3), we acquired that the stability of fct or hcp phases depends on the Ti:Al ratios. When the ratio meets about 1.5, the formation energies of fct and hcp phases are very close, which means both structures have the similar stability. Further shear deformation calculations on such alloys with different structures and compositions show that phases with Ti:Al value close to 1.5 have smaller dislocation nucleation energies and lower maximum shear strengths than those of the stoichiometric TiAl and Ti3Al phases. Such results not only reveal the composition's effect on the reversible phase transition, but also exhibit the intrinsic controlling role on the alloying properties. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation of uniaxial tension along [001] has been performed to study the influence of various surface defects on the initiation of plastic deformation and fracture of $\gamma$-TiAl single crystals. The results indicate that brittle fracture occurs in perfect bulk; surfaces and edges will be detrimental to the strength of materials and provide dislocation nucleation site. The defects on surfaces and edges cause further weakening with various effects depending on defect type, size, position and orientation, while the edge dimples are the most influential. For $\gamma$-TiAl rods with surface dimples, dislocations nucleate from an edge of the rod when dimples are small, dimple dislocation nucleation occurs only when the dimples are larger than a strain rate dependent critical size. The dislocations nucleated upon [001] tension are super dislocations with Burger vectors {\textless}011] or 1/2 {\textless} 112] containing four 1/6 {\textless} 112 {\textgreater} partials. The effects of surface scratches are orientation and shape sensitive. Scratches parallel to the loading direction have little influence, while sharp ones perpendicular to the loading direction may cause crack and thus should be avoided. This simulation also shows that, any type of surface defect would lower strength, and cause crack in some cases. But some may facilitate dislocation nucleation and improve ductility of TiAl if well controlled.},

abstract = {An investigation on the effect of aging on the tensile properties and creep behavior of a fully lamellar (FL) Ti-47Al-2Nb-1Mn-0.5W-0.5Mo-0.2Si (at.{\%}) alloy is presented. Aging at intermediate temperatures produces precipitate particles predominantly along $\alpha$2/$\gamma$ lamellar interfaces or within $\alpha$2 lamellae. Most of the precipitates are $\beta$-particles with fewer silicides. Aging at intermediate temperatures leads to increased tensile strength as a result of precipitation of $\beta$ and silicide particles. In addition, aging yields an increased primary creep resistance but a shortened creep life for the FL structure. The shortened creep life of the aged FL structures could be a result of early decomposition of $\alpha$2 lamellae during creep. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to study the growth of spherical nano-voids and the fracture properties of $\gamma$-TiAl single crystal. It is found that the emission of shear loops is the primary mechanism of the void growth: continued production of dislocation cores and the propagation of shear loops make the void grow. Cracks originate from the deformed area near the void surface. As the cracks propagate to the void surface and to the crystal boundaries, $\gamma$-TiAl single crystal finally fractures. The dependence of the void growth on the specimen size, strain rate, and void volume fraction was also investigated. The incipient yield strength decreases as the specimen size or void volume fraction increases, but increases with the increase of the strain rate. Young's modulus is only sensitive to the void volume fraction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This microstructure is largely dominated by twin-related variants which are separated by either twin interfaces or thin alpha(2) slabs. The alloy deforms at both temperatures by ordinary dislocations and twins. Deformation in a particular gamma variant and its adjacent twin-related variant involves the same kind of glide system, either ordinary dislocations or twins. This property is found to be true for all twin-related lamellae. The occurrence of this correlated glide is explained by the introduction of the notion of pilot and driven orientations. The lamellar orientation in which the operating glide system is activated on the basis of Schmid factor considerations is termed the pilot orientation. It imposes its deformation system on to the twin-related lamella, called the driven orientation, whose deformation may not involve the slip system most favoured by the applied stress.},

@article{Rao1994,
abstract = {In lamellar TiAl the flat-plate geometry of the grains, the barriers to deformation across the grain boundaries and the coherency stresses all contribute to a marked anisotropy in the yield and fracture stresses of the material . Both yield and fracture occur at low stresses when the deformation is within the lamellae (soft mode) and they occur at high stresses when the deformation crosses the lamellae (hard mode). The anisotropy is enhanced by a new effect which can soften the soft mode and harden the hard mode: the geometry of the lamellar boundary produces degeneracies in the planar fault energies at the interfaces which enhance the mobilities of dislocations on these interfaces. These degeneracies modify the core structure of dislocations on or near the interfaces, consequently soft mode dislocations can dissociate widely and move more easily when their glide plane is contained in the interface. Hard mode dislocations can substantially reduce their core energies when intersecting a $\gamma$/$\gamma$ interface, and subsequently become immobilized, by cross slipping on to the interface plane. This paper presents a discussion of the geometry and relative energies of the $\gamma$/$\gamma$ interfaces using elements of Bollman O-lattice theory. In order to investigate the influence of the interfaces on dislocation core structure we have fit an empirical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential to the structural and elastic properties of bulk L10 TiAl. The mobility and core structure of the twinning dislocation at the 180° interface and the perfect, 1/ 2〈110] screw dislocation at the 60° and 120° interfaces were calculated using molecular statics within the EAM. We have also studied the influence of one and two atomic step ledges on dislocation mobility in the 12° interface. We find in general that dislocations are more glissile on the $\gamma$/$\gamma$ interfaces, as compared to bulk TiAl and that ledges are weak barriers to dislocation glide. The interfaces themselves are strong barriers to 1/2〈110] screw dislocations gliding on conjugate (111) planes are trapped at these interfaces, as a result of lower core energies for screw dislocations lying in the interface.},

abstract = {The growth and coalescence of voids in magnesium single crystals at the nanoscale have been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and the embedded atom method. One void and two void specimens with identical initial void volume fractions were utilized to study the mechanism of void growth and coalescence. In order to study the influences of material length scale on void evolution in single crystals four specimen sizes with the same initial volume fraction of voids were considered. Investigations of the effects of temperature and strain rate were also performed. Uniaxial stress-strain curves were monitored during increasing employed strain. The simulation results show that the specimen size, loading strain rate and temperature had apparent influences on the twin or dislocation pattern, void evolution shape and uniaxial stress-strain responses, but negligible effects on the initial slopes of the uniaxial stress-strain curves. Furthermore, the nucleation stress of twin bands in orientation A - x[0 0 0 1]-y[1 over(2, ̄) 1 0]-z[1 0 over(1, ̄) 0] was much higher than that of plastic deformation in orientation B - x[1 over(2, ̄) 1 0]-y[1 0 over(1, ̄) 0]-z[0 0 0 1].},

The results concluded that full load show an increase in efficiency when compared with diesel, highest efficiency is obtained with B20MEOJBA with compression ratio 17.5. It is noted that there is an increase in thermal efficiency as the blend ratio increases. Biodiesel blend has performance closer to diesel, but emission is reduced in all blends of B20MEOJBA compared to diesel.

In this paper, Vasily Bulatov and colleagues take on the challenge of modelling metal plasticity at the atomic level. Such simulations require models that contain many millions of atoms (the largest simulation in this study contains 268 million atoms), and algorithms are used to process the datasets down to a volume that allows human interpretation. The authors probe ultrahigh-strain-rate deformation in body-centred-cubic tantalum, a model metal, to investigate the limits of metal plasticity. They show that at certain limiting conditions, dislocations can no longer relieve metal loading and twinning takes over. At a strain rate lower than this limit, flow stress and dislocation density achieve a steady state and a sort of metal kneading is observed. The simulations support previous proposals of the maximum dislocation density that can be reached before a metal collapses.},

abstract = {The evolution, growth and coalescence, of nanovoids play a significant role in the plasticity of nanocrystalline metallic materials. Previous atomistic studies of void growth in face centered copper, and other metallic materials, have considered voids in single crystals, and those located at grain boundaries in polycrystals. The evolution of a spherical nanovoid in copper polycrystals under uniaxial tension is the focus of this atomistic investigation. In this paper, a critical stress based criterion is proposed for emission of dislocations from spherical void surfaces. The preference of dislocation source, GBs or spherical void surfaces, is determined by the relative magnitude of the critical stresses to emit dislocations from GBs or spherical void surfaces. The criterion reveals that there exists a grain size dependent critical void diameter at which the dislocation emission transits from GBs to spherical void surfaces as the spherical void grows. Simulation results show that, in intragranular voided models, the critical void diameter is 13 nm for simulation models with a 16.32 nm grain size and is 5.5 nm for simulation models with a 6.92 nm grain size. The critical void diameters revealed by simulations are in agreement with that obtained by the criterion. In addition, the simulation results indicate that the Gurson's model may be extended to predict the global yield conditions for simulation models with intragranular spherical voids. In the simulation models with intergranular voids, the spherical void continuously grows due to the initial dislocation emission from the intersections of GBs and spherical void surfaces.},

abstract = {A method has been developed whereby the velocity of motion of fresh dislocations introduced into a crystal by scratching the surface may be measured as a function of stress. The velocities of unpinned edge dislocations in 3¼{\%} silicon‐iron have been measured as a function of stress over a range of five orders of magnitude in velocity from 10−7 cm/sec to 10−2 cm/sec. The velocity has been found to be very sensitive to the applied stress in this velocity range. Measurements of velocity as a function of stress have been made for four temperatures in the range 78°K to 373°K. It has been found that over this range of temperature the yield stress changes with temperature in the same way as the stress to produce a constant velocity of dislocationmotion. From the result it is concluded that the rise in yield stress at low temperatures exhibited by this siliconiron is due primarily to an increase in the lattice resistance to dislocationmotion and not to an increase in the Cottrell locking force. Preliminary experiments on pinned dislocations suggest that there may also be an effect of temperature on the strength of pinning by impurities which would be superimposed on the increase in lattice resistance with decreasing temperature.},

The deformation mechanism of $\alpha$ phase is dynamic recovery at 1275 °C, whereas $\gamma$ phase is mainly dynamic recrystallized. It is revealed that $\alpha$ phase is softer and easier to be deformed when the alloy is deformed at 1275 °C. The reasons of the different deformation behavior between 1225 °C and 1275. °C, as well as the different deformation behavior between $\alpha$ phase and $\gamma$ phase are analyzed. A multistep deformation process at gradually lowered temperature is proposed to eliminate the adverse influence of remnant lamellar structure on mechanical properties.},

abstract = {In this paper the occurrence of twinning parallel to the lamellae during compression at 700 °C of a polycrystalline nearly lamellar commercial $\gamma$-TiAl alloy, Ti-45Al-2Nb-2Mn(at{\%})-0.8 vol{\%} TiB2, has been studied and shown to lead to the formation of cracks at colony boundaries. However, the occurrence of this longitudinal twinning mode was less common by at least a factor of ten in tests at room temperature. Furthermore, the debonding of colony boundaries caused by the shear strain of longitudinal twinning is exacerbated when the same $\gamma$-TiAl variant favourably oriented for twinning occurs repeatedly in the lamellar structure. This effect was caused by the preferential nucleation of certain $\gamma$-TiAl variants in the presence of TiB2boride reinforcement. It is shown that the boride additions increase the probability of double, triple or even higher order multiply stacked $\gamma$-variants. This increases the resulting shear strain that must be accommodated and hence the probability of crack nucleation.},

A second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method interatomic potential for the binary nickel-titanium system is determined by improving the unary descriptions of pure nickel and pure titanium, especially regarding the physical properties at finite temperatures. The resulting potential reproduces accurately the hexagonal-close-packed to body-centered-cubic phase transition in Ti and the martensitic B2-B19 transformation in equiatomic NiTi. Subsequent large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations validate that the developed potential can be successfully applied for studies on temperature-and stress-induced martensitic phase transitions related to core applications of shape-memory alloys. A simulation of the temperature-induced phase transition provides insights into the effect of sizes and constraints on the formation of nanotwinned martensite structures with multiple domains. A simulation of the stress-induced phase transition of a nanosized pillar indicates a full recovery of the initial structure after the loading and unloading processes, illustrating a superelastic behavior of the target system.},

abstract = {Background: In Switzerland approximately 30{\%} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected individuals have been diagnosed. To enhance this rate, new detection strategies are needed. The aim of this project was to analyze the distribution of HCV cases in Switzerland to develop better detection strategies. Methods: A previously described HCV disease burden model was populated with Swiss assumptions regarding HCV prevalence, viremic rate and age distribution. The viremic population was aged from 1998 to 2013 accounting for mortality and cure rates, and was stratified according to birth cohort. The number of screenings required to identify one viremic case was calculated as 1/(viremic HCV prevalence). Costs in Swiss Francs (CHF) associated with diagnosing and genotyping one viremic case were estimated as follows - [CHF 25*({\#} anti-HCV tests administered)] + [CHF 180*({\#} HCV-RNA tests administered for anti-HCV positive cases)] + [CHF 180*({\#} genotype tests administered for HCV-RNA positive cases)]. Results: More than 50{\%} of the viremic HCV infected population was born during 1954-1973, with 73{\%} born during 1949-1978. Random screening would require {\textgreater}100 anti-HCV tests (in addition to further confirmatory tests) to find one current HCV case, while screening in the 1949-1978 cohort (36-65 years of age) could find one case per 59 persons screened. Screening in the 1949-1978 cohort would cost CHF 1,890 (USD {\$}2,110) per positive diagnosis, as compared with a CHF 2,790 ({\$}3,115) cost for random screening. Screening by 5-year cohort could find anywhere from one case per 56 screened (1974-1978 cohort, 12{\%} of the viremic population) to one case per 5,855 screened (2009-2013 cohort, {\textless}1{\%} of the viremic population) Conclusion: The most efficient birth-year screening strategy would target persons born between 1949 and 1978 (35 - 64 years of age), as this cohort accounts for over 70{\%} of viremic cases and requires screening of only 59 individuals to identify one viremic HCV infected case. Targeted birth cohort screening is more efficient and cost effective than random screening. (Table Presented).},

The interactions between the crack tip and vacancies were found to modify the stress concentrations at the crack tip. Increase in vacancy content lead to increased crack tip blunting and reduced crack propagation speeds as compared to the vacancy-free material, thereby toughening the material to fracture.

Ion beams create radiation damage efficiently without material activation, but their limited penetration depth requires small-scale testing. However, strength measurements of nanoscale irradiated specimens have not been previously performed. Here we show that yield strengths approaching macroscopic values are measured from irradiated {\~{}}400 nm-diameter copper specimens. Quantitative in situ nanocompression testing in a transmission electron microscope reveals that the strength of larger samples is controlled by dislocation-irradiation defect interactions, yielding size-independent strengths. Below {\~{}}400 nm, size-dependent strength results from dislocation source limitation. This transition length-scale should be universal, but depends on material and irradiation conditions. We conclude that for irradiated copper, and presumably related materials, nanoscale in situ testing can determine bulk-like yield strengths and simultaneously identify deformation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze nanovoid growth in single crystalline vanadium under tension. Radial distribution function at the first nearest neighbor distance was calculated to find out the critical strain rate below which the deformation of specimen was static. Then a tensile stress was exerted on both void contained box and intact box under two constraint conditions. Homogenous dislocations were nucleated in intact box at yield point; while for void contained box with void radius twice the lattice constant, 〈1 1 1〉{\{}1 1 0{\}} shear loops were punched out from void surface. The formation of shear loops was the result of the splitting of purely screw cores on three non-planar planes, as well as their transformations to more stable two-fold non-planar dislocations under tension. The asymmetry of loops was influenced by both strain rate and triaxiality of system. It is also found that, in lower rate cases the yield point and peak stress point coincided; however, the two points separated at higher rate due to the inadequate void growth rate. Mean square displacement of void surface atoms were given out to geometrically depict the void evolution. Moreover, simulations with different initial porosity and box size were performed respectively. It is shown that when void reduced to contain only one vacancy, dislocations can be nucleated independently of the void; when porosity was large enough, the interactions between void and its periodic images were noticeable. Also, when both the void and box were large, triangular prismatic loops on {\{}1 1 0{\}} planes were observed at void surface, which may be contributed to a combined effect of the intersection of shear loops and the ledges along the void surface. Finally, the results of our MD simulations agreed well with that from Lubarda equation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The change in microhardness was found to occur in two stages regardless of the amount of reduction; the first stage associated with the decrease in dislocation density and the second stage related with the annealing-out of deformation twins introduced in TiAl lamallae during rolling. However, the recrystallization mode was found to vary depending on the amount of reduction in thickness. In specimens rolled to less than 20{\%} reduction in thickness, the full recovery in hardness occurs preserving the lamellar structure. In contrast, in specimens rolled to more than 40{\%}, a structure composed of equiaxed grains of TiAl is obtained after recrystallization. A mechanism is proposed to interpret the unusual recrystallization behavior of PST crystals of TiAl cold-rolled to less than 20{\%}. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently - those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers - the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

The internal stress was determined as the critical stress at which the inelastic sample relaxation is reversed, i.e. going from the tensile direction to the compression direction. The investigation involves a wide range of alloy compositions with a corresponding variation in the strength properties. For the alloys investigated, the internal stress is about 80{\%} of the yield stress.

During the compression, the nano-void crystal undergoes elastic then plastic deformation process. In the elastic period, the nano-void shrinks linearly along compression direction while it expands linearly along the directions perpendicular to the compression direction. Finally, the nano-void collapses from all directions at the beginning of the plastic process. The formation and extension of dislocations and the shrinking mechanism of void were analyzed in detail. The dependence of the void shrinking on the specimen size, strain rate, and void volume fraction were also investigated. It is found that the stacking faults' slipping in the crystal during plastic period is the main deformation mechanism of the void shrinkage: dislocation structures initially start to nucleate around the equator area of the void, then partial dislocations and planar faults constantly propagate, finally the stacking faults and partial dislocations swap through the entire system and the void shrinks.},

abstract = {The activation of slip at room temperature in lamellae of alpha(2)-Ti3Al in a Ti-48 at.{\%} Al alloy has been studied using transmission electron microscopy In common with other studies, it appears that slip activity occurs mainly at, or near to, the intersection of certain cross-lamellar twins, formed by deformation in gamma-TiAl, with the alpha(2) lamellae. In polycrystalline samples, heat treated to a duplex microstructure with a significant lamellar component, only dislocations with Burgers vectors given by b = 1/3[{\textless}11(2)over bar 0{\textgreater}] have been activated, and essentially no dislocations with b = 1/3[1126], that is c-component dislocations, have been observed after deformation in tension at room temperature. It has been found that, for these samples slip activity in alpha(2)-Ti3Al may occur either by a slip transmission process or by stress-induced activation of sources in the interfaces between the two phases (alpha(2)-Ti3Al and gamma-TiAl). The resultant defects are superdislocations with Burgers vectors b = 1/3({\textless}11(2)over bar 0{\textgreater}) gliding on prismatic {\{}{\textless}1(1)over bar 00{\textgreater}{\}} and/or pyramidal {\{}{\textless}2(2)over bar 01{\textgreater}{\}} planes. In contrast with the observations made on polycrystalline material, in samples of polysynthetically twinned crystals deformed in compression parallel to [111](gamma)//[0001](alpha 2) activity of c-component dislocations has been observed. It is shown that, in all cases studied, the experimental results are consistent with the stress-induced activation of sources in the interfaces, rather than transmission of slip from gamma-TiAl. The results are discussed with reference to the influence of this shear transfer across alpha(2)-lamellae on tensile ductility in alloys of gamma-TiAl.},

abstract = {Precipitation is an efficient method to strengthen metallic materials. While precipitation hardening effects on dislocation slip have been studied extensively in the past, the influence of precipitates on twinning mediated plasticity and the development of corresponding hardening models that account for twin-precipitate interactions have received less attention. Here, the interaction of {\{}10-12{\}} extension twin boundaries (TBs) in pure magnesium with precipitates of plate-, sphere- and rod-like shapes is studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find that TBs that engulf precipitates are absorbed by the precipitate-matrix interfaces, and the precipitates are neither twinned nor sheared but deform elastically leading to their rotation. TBs can pass small precipitates (length? 20 nm) and remain intact. In contrast when TBs are interacting with large precipitates (length? 50 nm), basal dislocations or stacking faults nucleate from the interfaces, causing local plastic relaxation. The stress field around a plate-like precipitate as calculated in the MD simulations suggests that a strong back-stress is imposed on the TBs. We then coarse grain these mechanisms into an analytical mean field model of precipitation hardening on twinning in magnesium alloys, which is based on the energy conservation during the TB-precipitate interaction. The model is in good agreement with the current MD simulations and published experimental observations. The hardening model shows that spherical precipitates have the strongest hardening effect on twinning, basal and prismatic plate-like precipitates have a medium effect while rod-like precipitates exert the weakest influence. We also find that most types of precipitates show a stronger hardening effect on twinning mediated plasticity than on basal dislocation slip. Finally, prismatic plate-like precipitates are predicted to have reasonable hardening effects on both twinning and basal slip. These results can help guiding the development of magnesium alloys with enhanced strength and ductility.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multiscale modeling framework based on microscale crystal plasticity theory and macroscale element-free methodology for computational simulation of polycrystalline metals. The element-free method employs an improved moving least squares (IMLS) shape function in the Ritz procedure for computational simulation. In the multiscale modeling scheme, the macroscale strain increments of polycrystalline metals are solved by the element-free method and transferred into the mesoscale grains through a scale transition law, and further transferred into the microscale slip systems through the Schmid's law. The shear strain increments of all grains are then summed up and averaged to calculate the macroscale plastic strain increment. Functions of the temperature-related hardening parameters of the slip systems are determined by calibrating with experimental data. Then, tensile tests are performed on polycrystalline sheets to study their deformation behavior at elevated temperatures. The plasticity of polycrystalline sheets is found to be significantly affected by the grain size. The concentration of shear stress and additional hardening are occurred at the grain boundaries of soft and hard grains. Moreover, it is revealed that the yield strength of the polycrystalline sheets is greatly reduced as the hardening parameters and thermal softening factor decrease at elevated temperatures.},

abstract = {The stress-induced phase-transition $\gamma$-TiAl ↔ $\alpha$2-Ti3Al in TiAl alloys was systemically studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that the key role in such phase-transition is the alloy composition. Firstly through studying the relationship between the formation energy, structure (fct and hcp) and alloy composition (Ti:Al = 1-3), we acquired that the stability of fct or hcp phases depends on the Ti:Al ratios. When the ratio meets about 1.5, the formation energies of fct and hcp phases are very close, which means both structures have the similar stability. Further shear deformation calculations on such alloys with different structures and compositions show that phases with Ti:Al value close to 1.5 have smaller dislocation nucleation energies and lower maximum shear strengths than those of the stoichiometric TiAl and Ti3Al phases.

abstract = {Successful scientific applications of large-scale molecular dynamics often rely on automated methods for identifying the local crystalline structure of condensed phases. Many existing methods for structural identification, such as Common Neighbour Analysis, rely on interatomic distances (or thresholds thereof) to classify atomic structure. As a consequence they are sensitive to strain and thermal displacements, and preprocessing such as quenching or temporal averaging of the atomic positions is necessary to provide reliable identifications. We propose a new method, Polyhedral Template Matching (PTM), which classifies structures according to the topology of the local atomic environment, without any ambiguity in the classification, and with greater reliability than e.g. Common Neighbour Analysis in the presence of thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that the method can reliably be used to identify structures even in simulations near the melting point, and that it can identify the most common ordered alloy structures as well. In addition, the method makes it easy to identify the local lattice orientation in polycrystalline samples, and to calculate the local strain tensor. An implementation is made available under a Free and Open Source Software license.},

Designing materials for radiation environments necessitates a fundamental understanding of how radiation-induced defects alter mechanical properties. Ion beams create radiation damage efficiently without material activation, but their limited penetration depth requires small-scale testing. However, strength measurements of nanoscale irradiated specimens have not been previously performed. Here we show that yield strengths approaching macroscopic values are measured from irradiated {\~{}}400 nm-diameter copper specimens. Quantitative in situ nanocompression testing in a transmission electron microscope reveals that the strength of larger samples is controlled by dislocation-irradiation defect interactions, yielding size-independent strengths. Below {\~{}}400 nm, size-dependent strength results from dislocation source limitation. This transition length-scale should be universal, but depends on material and irradiation conditions. We conclude that for irradiated copper, and presumably related materials, nanoscale in situ testing can determine bulk-like yield strengths and simultaneously identify deformation mechanisms.},

abstract = {The evolution, growth and coalescence, of nanovoids play a significant role in the plasticity of nanocrystalline metallic materials. Previous atomistic studies of void growth in face centered copper, and other metallic materials, have considered voids in single crystals, and those located at grain boundaries in polycrystals. The evolution of a spherical nanovoid in copper polycrystals under uniaxial tension is the focus of this atomistic investigation. In this paper, a critical stress based criterion is proposed for emission of dislocations from spherical void surfaces. The preference of dislocation source, GBs or spherical void surfaces, is determined by the relative magnitude of the critical stresses to emit dislocations from GBs or spherical void surfaces. The criterion reveals that there exists a grain size dependent critical void diameter at which the dislocation emission transits from GBs to spherical void surfaces as the spherical void grows. Simulation results show that, in intragranular voided models, the critical void diameter is 13 nm for simulation models with a 16.32 nm grain size and is 5.5 nm for simulation models with a 6.92 nm grain size. The critical void diameters revealed by simulations are in agreement with that obtained by the criterion. In addition, the simulation results indicate that the Gurson's model may be extended to predict the global yield conditions for simulation models with intragranular spherical voids. In the simulation models with intergranular voids, the spherical void continuously grows due to the initial dislocation emission from the intersections of GBs and spherical void surfaces.},

abstract = {Abstract Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to study the shrinkage of spherical nano-void under uniaxial compression load in $\gamma$-TiAl single crystal. During the compression, the nano-void crystal undergoes elastic then plastic deformation process. In the elastic period, the nano-void shrinks linearly along compression direction while it expands linearly along the directions perpendicular to the compression direction. Finally, the nano-void collapses from all directions at the beginning of the plastic process. The formation and extension of dislocations and the shrinking mechanism of void were analyzed in detail. The dependence of the void shrinking on the specimen size, strain rate, and void volume fraction were also investigated. It is found that the stacking faults' slipping in the crystal during plastic period is the main deformation mechanism of the void shrinkage: dislocation structures initially start to nucleate around the equator area of the void, then partial dislocations and planar faults constantly propagate, finally the stacking faults and partial dislocations swap through the entire system and the void shrinks.},

abstract = {The aged-rejuvenation-glue-liquid (ARGL) shear band model has been proposed for metallic glasses (Acta Mater. 54 (2006) 4293), based on small-scale molecular dynamics simulations up to 20,000 atoms and thermomechanical analysis. The model predicts the existence of a critical lengthscale similar to 10 nm, above which melting could occur in shear-alienated glass. Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with up to 5 million atoms have directly verified this prediction. When the applied stress exceeds the glue traction (computed separately before in a shear cohesive zone, or an amorphous-amorphous "generalized stacking fault energy" calculation), we indeed observe maturation of the shear band embryo into bona fide shear crack, accompanied by melting. In contrast, when the applied stress is below the glue traction, the shear band embryo does not propagate, becomes diffuse, and eventually dies. Thus this all-important quantity, the glue traction which is a property of shear-alienated glass, controls the macroscopic yield point of well-aged glass. We further suggest that the disruption of chemical short-range order ("chemical softening") governs the glue traction microscopically. Catastrophic thermal softening occurs only after chemical alienation and softening in our simulation, after the shear band embryo has already run a critical length.},

abstract = {During the past decade considerable research efforts have been directed towards achieving balanced engineering properties of two-phase $\gamma$-titanium aluminide alloys for future applications as structural materials. For optimization of mechanical properties such as yield and creep strengths, tensile ductility and fracture resistance, a basic understanding of the temperature dependent micromechanisms of plasticity and fracture, and their interplay with various microstructural constituents is required. In this review article, the current knowledge on dislocation types and slip systems, the development of deformation substructures, factors controlling the mobility and multiplication of dislocations, interface related plasticity, solid solution and precipitate strengthening mechanisms as well as microscopic aspects of creep and fracture will be addressed. These topics will be related to specific microstructures and associated engineering properties. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ti3Al/TiAl interfaces and TiAl/TiAlT thermal twin boundaries were investigated by transmission electron microscopy in a Ti-42 at.{\%}Al as-cast and homogenized alloy. Intrinsic and extrinsic interfacial dislocations (IIDs and EIDs respectively) have been found on the Ti3Al/TiAl interfaces. The IIDs consist of two types of arrays, one of which predominantly aligns along [112] of TiAl, undergoing the dissociation: 1 2[110] → 1 6[211] + (ABP′ + SISF′) + 1 6[121]. Another type aligns close to [110] of TiAl with Burgers vector 1 6[112]. The characteristics of the IIDs are associated with lattice misfits on the interfaces. The EIDs appear with arbitrary alignment and undergo various dissociations, which have no correlation with the interfacial misfits. It is suggested that the EIDs are generated both on the interfaces and also from the interior of Ti3Al or TiAl lamellae. The interaction between IIDs and EIDs results in a distorted IID configuration that is subject to the variation of the planar faults bounded by the dissociated IID and EID partials. Thermal twin plates in the lamellar structure are always present neighbouring Ti3Al lamellae. Split triple-partials of 1 6{\textless}112] were resolved on the TiAl/TiAlT thermal twin boundaries as opposed to the singly present partials on deformation twin boundaries in TiAl. It is suggested that the thermal twinning is related to the triplets structure which is probably generated by the dissociation of 1 2{\textless}112] superdislocations. The potential influence of the interfaces on the mechanical properties of such two-phase alloys has been discussed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The deformation behaviour of two-phase ($\alpha$2+ $\gamma$) titanium aluminide alloys with a lamellar microstructure was investigated by conventional and high resolution electron microscopy. With regard to the mechanical properties, the structures of the interfacial boundaries occurring in these materials are characterized and the interaction mechanisms of the deformation processes with these interfaces is investigated. Accordingly, the misfit dislocations present at semicoherent $\alpha$2/$\gamma$ and $\gamma$/$\gamma$ interfaces assist the generation of dislocations and deformation twins. On the other hand, the semicoherent interfaces act as very effective barriers impeding the propagation of slip across the lamellae. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

The effects of microstructure on tensile properties and deformation-fracture behavior are analyzed for deformation temperatures below and above the brittle-ductile transition. The crack initiation toughness and associated strains near the crack tip are used to explain the inverse relationship between ductility and toughness observed at room temperature. Fracture resistance behavior and toughening mechanisms at room temperature are explained in terms of microstructure and deformation anisotropy. The competition between the effects of grain size and lamellar spacing or tensile and toughness properties is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

@article{Zope2003,
abstract = {Semiempirical interatomic potentials have been developed for Al, $\alpha$−Ti, and $\gamma$−TiAl within the embedded atom method (EAM) formalism by fitting to a large database of experimental as well as ab initio data. The ab initio calculations were performed by the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method within the density functional theory to obtain the equations of state for a number of crystal structures of the Ti-Al system. Some of the calculated LAPW energies were used for fitting the potentials while others for examining their quality. The potentials correctly predict the equilibrium crystal structures of the phases and accurately reproduce their basic lattice properties. The potentials are applied to calculate the energies of point defects, surfaces, and planar faults in the equilibrium structures. Unlike earlier EAM potentials for the Ti-Al system, the proposed potentials provide a reasonable description of the lattice thermal expansion, demonstrating their usefulness for molecular-dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations at high temperatures. The energy along the tetragonal deformation path (Bain transformation) in $\gamma$−TiAl calculated with the EAM potential is in fairly good agreement with LAPW calculations. Equilibrium point defect concentrations in $\gamma$−TiAl are studied using the EAM potential. It is found that antisite defects strongly dominate over vacancies at all compositions around stoichiometry, indicating that $\gamma$−TiAl is an antisite disorder compound, in agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {We report single crystal phase and non-tapered wurtzite (WZ) and zincblende twinning superlattice (ZB TSL) InP nanowires (NWs). The NWs are grown in a metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) reactor using the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism and in situ etching with HCl at a high growth temperature. Our stacking fault-free WZ and ZB TSL NWs allow access to the fundamental properties of both NW crystal structures, whose optical and electronic behaviors are often screened by polytypism or incorporated impurities. The WZ NWs show no acceptor-related emission, implying that the VLS-grown NW is almost free of impurities due to sidewall removal by HCl. They only emit light at the free exciton (1.491 eV) and the donor bound exciton transition (1.4855 eV). The ZB NWs exhibit a photoluminescence spectrum being unaffected by the twinning planes. Surprisingly, the acceptor-related emission in the ZB NWs can be almost completely removed by etching away the impurity-contaminated sidewall grown via a vapor-solid mechanism.},

@article{Groh2009,
abstract = {This paper describes a numerical, hierarchical multiscale modeling methodology involving two distinct bridges over three different length scales that predicts the work hardening of face centered cubic crystals in the absence of physical experiments. This methodology builds a clear bridging approach connecting nano-, micro- and meso-scales. In this methodology, molecular dynamics simulations (nanoscale) are performed to generate mobilities for dislocations. A discrete dislocations numerical tool (microscale) then uses the mobility data obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations to determine the work hardening. The second bridge occurs as the material parameters in a slip system hardening law employed in crystal plasticity models (mesoscale) are determined by the dislocation dynamics simulation results. The material parameters are computed using a correlation procedure based on both the functional form of the hardening law and the internal elastic stress/plastic shear strain fields computed from discrete dislocations. This multiscale bridging methodology was validated by using a crystal plasticity model to predict the mechanical response of an aluminum single crystal deformed under uniaxial compressive loading along the [4 2 1] direction. The computed strain-stress response agrees well with the experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A recent example with regard to structural materials is the emergence of lightweight intermetallic TiAl alloys. Their excellent high-temperature mechanical properties, low density, and high stiffness constitute a profile perfectly suitable for their application as advanced aero-engine turbine blades or as turbocharger turbine wheels in next-generation automotive engines. Advanced so-called 3 rd generation TiAl alloys, such as the TNM alloy described in this paper, are complex multi-phase alloys which can be processed by ingot or powder metallurgy as well as precision casting methods. Each process leads to specific microstructures which can be altered and optimized by thermo-mechanical processing and/or subsequent heat treatments.},
