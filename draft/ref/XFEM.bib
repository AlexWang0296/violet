abstract = {A numerical model that can predict the influence of martensitic phase transformation on crack propagation is proposed. The model is comprised of a large strain plasticity model that accounts for martensitic phase transformation and a cohesive zone model to simulate the interface behavior. Different dependencies of the traction-separation law on the local volume fraction of martensite are investigated. Furthermore, as martensitic phase transformation is strongly temperature dependent, different isothermal settings are considered. It is, for example, verified that at lower temperatures, martensitic phase transformation retards crack propagation to a greater extent. It is also shown that the retarding effect depends on how the martensite dependent cohesive zone model is formulated.},

abstract = {Contact stresses distributions may substantially reduce the fatigue life of components subject to fretting, leading to early unexpected failures. Accurately predicting the components lives is, therefore, an important topic to be addressed, in particular from a design point of view. This topic has received great attention in the past decades and several numerical tools that better estimate these components lives have been proposed. In this paper, the focus is in the crack initiation phase. At this stage, it is important to correctly predict the crack initiation location and orientation, which is often achieved by using critical plane approaches. Instead, the use of cohesive zone model (CZM) as an alternative approach to accurately estimate those parameters is investigated. Cohesive zone model as well as two of its common initiation criteria, namely quadratic traction-separation criterion and maximum nominal stress criterion, are used to study crack initiation location and orientation under fretting conditions. Our results are compared with the traditional critical plane approaches and with experimental data, suggesting that cohesive approaches can accurately be used in crack initiation prediction.},

@unpublished{Sun2012,
abstract = {The cohesive zone fracture model was introduced partially to remove the stress singularity in the classical continuum crack model and partially to incorporate the physically more realistic material separation mechanisms at the atomic scale. The cohesive zone model adds a zone of vanishing thickness ahead of the crack tip with the intention of describing more realistically the fracture process without the use of stress singularity. The cohesive zone is idealized as two cohesive surfaces, which are held together by a cohesive traction. The material failure is characterized by the complete separation of the cohesive surfaces and the separation process is described by a cohesive law that relates the cohesive traction and the relative displacement of the cohesive surfaces. Hence, a physical crack extension occurs when the separation displacement at the tail of the cohesive zone (physical crack tip) reaches a critical value. One of the key advantages offered by the cohesive zone model is that it has an intrinsic fracture energy dissipation mechanism in contrast to the classical continuum based fracture mechanics for which such a mechanism is absent.},

@article{Cavaliere2017,
abstract = {The cold-spray process has recently been recognized as a very useful tool for repairing metallic sheets, achieving desired adhesion strengths when employing optimal combinations of material process parameters. We present herein the possibility of repairing cracks in aluminum sheets by cold spray. A 2099 aluminum alloy panel with a surface 30° V notch was repaired by cold spraying of 2198 and 7075 aluminum alloy powders. The crack behavior of V-notched sheets subjected to bending loading was studied by finite-element modeling (FEM) and mechanical experiments. The simulations and mechanical results showed good agreement, revealing a remarkable K factor reduction, and a consequent reduction in crack nucleation and growth velocity. The results enable prediction of the failure initiation locus in the case of repaired panels subjected to bending loading and deformation. The stress concentration was quantified to show how the residual stress field and failure are affected by the mechanical properties of the sprayed materials and by the geometrical and mechanical properties of the interface. It was demonstrated that the crack resistance increases more than sevenfold in the case of repair using AA2198 and that cold-spray repair can contribute to increased global fatigue life of cracked structures.},
