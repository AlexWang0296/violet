@article{Kauffmann2000,
abstract = {In this study a two-phase $\gamma$-TiAl based alloy with near gamma microstructure was deformed in uniaxial compression at room temperature. The deformation experiments were carried out at a strain rate of 2Ã—10-4s-1. The acoustic emission during deformation was monitored continuously using a root mean square voltmeter. Different annealing experiments between deformation cycles combined with transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed the formation of mechanical twins as the decisive mechanism for the acoustic emission.},

@article{Meriaux2010,
abstract = {In this study, a fretting fatigue test has been equipped with an acoustic emission (AE) device in order to identify the successive crack propagation mechanisms. The fretting fatigue crack nucleation and propagation is a complicated process. Cracks initiate and propagate firstly due to shearing (mode II) and then by tension (mode I). The crack propagation generates mechanical energy emission. Elastic waves appear and can be detected through AE. A complete analysis of the AE signals (multi-parameter analysis, location of the AE in the loading cycle and a statistical analysis) led to an identification of three different steps in the crack propagation process. The evolution of the shearing and the tension influences in the crack propagation process is recognizable separately. Therefore, the three crack propagation steps have been identified as (a) crack propagation in mode II, (b) mixed mode crack propagation and (c) pure mode I crack propagation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Kumar2009,
abstract = {Acoustic Emission (AE) studies have been performed on smooth and notched specimens of a near alpha titanium alloy under monotonic loading condition to study the effect of stress triaxiality on damage micromechanisms. The damage in the notched specimen was found to be of cleavage type as against the ductile type of damage in smooth specimen. This difference was distinguished in the AE energy evolution with notched specimen producing higher energy rate with lower total energy than that of smooth specimen. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract = {Samples of fully lamellar Ti44Al8Nb1B and Ti44Al4Nb4Hf0.2Si have been tested in tension at room temperature while they were interfaced to an acoustic emission system. The generation of acoustic signals, at stresses well below the 0.2{\%} yield stress and at higher stresses, has been shown to be due to the formation of cracks within individual lamellar colonies. Data obtained in the micro-strain region in loading-unloading measurements confirmed that there is significant plastic flow at stresses 200 MPa below the 0.2{\%} proof stress of 625 MPa, and it is inferred that this flow gives rise to the cracking.

@article{Vinogradov2002,
abstract = {Acoustic emission (AE) is investigated during cycling at a constant plastic strain amplitude of ultrafine-grain (UFG) copper produced by severe plastic deformation, aiming at detailed characterization of AE in the time and frequency domain and clarification of fatigue damage mechanisms. The results of AE analysis in UFG copper are compared with those obtained in conventional polycrystals and single crystals. It is shown that fatigue damage and corresponding AE in UFG copper is controlled by three main mechanisms: large-scale shear banding, mode I tensile crack opening and mode II shear crack propagation. No AE that could be associated with ordinary dislocation mechanisms typical for conventional coarse-grain metals was detected in the UFG state. A close connection between strain localization, crack nucleation and grain boundaries in UFG materials is emphasized. It is shown that annealing at a moderate temperature of UFG materials fabricated by severe plastic deformation can reduce the degree of strain localization, modify the fatigue mechanisms and improve the fatigue life significantly.},
