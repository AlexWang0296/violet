abstract = {Foreign object damage (FOD) in gas turbine engines occurs due to the ingestion of small inorganic particles (small stones and sand particles). The damage caused to the blade leading edge may lead to premature crack initiation and ultimately blade failure due the action of time-varying tensile loads. The problem of evaluating the severity of FOD and the induced reduction of component life was investigated in the laboratory, by reproducing the damage conditions accurately and subjecting the impacted blade to fatigue loading simulating the service conditions. One particular aspect of post-FOD analysis focuses on the evaluation of residual stresses in the vicinity of the notch. Residual stresses play an important r{\^{o}}le in controlling the rate of crack initiation and propagation, and may be responsible for accelerated crack growth if they are tensile ahead of the incipient crack, or can cause retardation otherwise. The present study was aimed at experimental and numerical investigate the magnitude and spatial variation of residual stresses in this region. Experimentally, a gas gun was used to introduce the damage by firing a hardened steel cube "point first". Following impact the residual stresses were evaluated using two different experimental techniques involving X-ray diffraction: laboratory low energy monochromatic stress measurement, and high-energy white beam synchrotron stress measurement. The results are compared with the numerical model of the impact phenomenon that was constructed for a selected portion of the blade material, and from which the residual stress pattern following simulated impact was calculated using Bammann damage material model. Both sets of experimental measurements are critically compared with the numerical result, and the relationship between them is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} IMechE 2016.Failure in steel weldments operating at high temperatures often occurs in the heat-affected zone adjacent to the weld. Such failures can be a result of material inhomogeneity within the heat-affected zone and in the case of tempered martensite steels have been linked with regions of untransformed $\alpha$ (ferrite) phase or over-tempered martensite within the intercritical region of the heat-affected zone. In this work, two-dimensional Voronoi tessellation is used to construct polygonal Voronoi cells to represent the microstructure of the heat-affected zone of a weld in a tempered martensite steel. The Voronoi construction is treated as a representative volume element of the material and is discretised by 8-node linear brick elements, with periodic boundary conditions. The lattice orientation at each material point is specified by three Euler angles, which are assumed to be randomly distributed, to represent the initial lack of texture in the intercritical region of the heat-affected zone. The constitutive response is represented by a nonlinear, rate-dependent, finite-strain crystal plasticity model. The results indicate that small amounts of ferrite can induce significant enhancements in stress and inelastic deformation at the interface of the ferrite and martensite grains. This localisation of stress and strain may be critical for microcrack and/or void formation and may be a contributory factor to Type IV cracking.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley Publishing Ltd. This paper presents a crystal plasticity model to predict the tensile response and crack initiation in a mixed ferrite-martensite material with a low volume fraction of pro-eutectoid ferrite, representative of a welding-induced intercritical heat-affected zone. It is shown that small volume fractions of ferrite can have a significant effect on material strength and ductility depending on the ferrite grain orientation. For relatively "soft" ferrite grains, microcracks can grow across interferrite ligaments with damage accumulating in the ferrite, leading to a reduction in strength and strain hardening, but with little influence on ductility; in contrast, relatively "hard" ferrite grains act to accelerate microcrack initiation, leading to reduced ductility, with negligible influence on strain hardening up to the maximum load.},

abstract = {Foreign object damage (FOD) has been identified as one of the primary life limiting factors for fan and compressor blades, with the leading edge of aerofoils particularly susceptible to such damage.In this study, a generic aerofoil specimen of Ti-6Al-4V alloy was used. The specimens were treated by laser shock peening (LSP) to generate compressive residual stresses in the leading edge region prior to impact. FOD was simulated by firing a cubical projectile at the leading edge using a laboratory gas gun at 200. m/s, head-on; and at 250. m/s, at an angle of 45Â°. The specimens were then subjected to 4-point bend fatigue testing under high cycle (HCF), low cycle (LCF) and combined LCF and HCF loading conditions.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterise the damage features due to FOD. Crack initiation and early crack growth due to FOD and subsequent fatigue growth were examined in detail. The results were compared between the two impact conditions; and with those from samples without LSP treatment as well as those impacted with spherical projectiles. The results seem to suggest that LSP has improved the crack growth resistance post FOD. Delayed onset of crack initiation was observed in LSPed samples compared to those without LSP under similar loading conditions. Damage features depend on the geometry of the projectile, the impact angle as well as the impact velocity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Dynamic compressive response of a dendrite-reinforced Ti-based bulk metallic glass composite is investigated. Strain rate dependencies of the max strength and strain energy density are illustrated. The inherent mechanisms are revealed by studying the dynamic deformation behaviors at lower and higher strain rates. Under high-rate loading, the deformation and fracture of the soft crystalline dendrites and the hard amorphous matrix are characterized, respectively. Then, their contributions to the failure of the composite material are discussed. Finally, the dynamic damage efficiency of the composite material is addressed.},
