abstract = {This article reviews continuum-based variational formulations for describing the elastic-plastic deformation of anisotropic heterogeneous crystalline matter. These approaches, commonly referred to as crystal plasticity finite-element models, are important both for basic microstructure-based mechanical predictions as well as for engineering design and performance simulations involving anisotropic media. Besides the discussion of the constitutive laws, kinematics, homogenization schemes and multiscale approaches behind these methods, we also present some examples, including, in particular, comparisons of the predictions with experiments. The applications stem from such diverse fields as orientation stability, microbeam bending, single-crystal and bicrystal deformation, nanoindentation, recrystallization, multiphase steel (TRIP) deformation, and damage prediction for the microscopic and mesoscopic scales and multiscale predictions of rolling textures, cup drawing, Lankfort (r) values and stamping simulations for the macroscopic scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

@article{Chandra2016,
abstract = {Fracture properties of a material are strongly influenced by the presence of defects. In view of this, molecular dynamics simulations were performed within the framework of embedded atom method to investigate the crack tip behavior under mode I loading in FCC Al with and without defects. Defects consisting of a random distribution of vacancies were introduced in the precracked matrix. The results reveal a significant change in the fracture behavior of Al with defects. The interactions between the crack tip and vacancies were found to modify the stress concentrations at the crack tip. Increase in vacancy content lead to increased crack tip blunting and reduced crack propagation speeds as compared to the vacancy-free material, thereby toughening the material to fracture. The significance of such studies towards gaining deeper insights into the fracture behavior at higher scales is highlighted.},

@article{Appel2016,
abstract = {Intermetallic titanium aluminide alloys based on the ordered face-centred tetragonal $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase represent a good example how fundamental and applied research along with industrial development can lead to a new and innovative class of advanced engineering materials. After almost three decades of intensive R{\&}D activities $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys have matured from "laboratory curiosities" to novel structural light-weight materials which eventually found their applications in aerospace and automotive industries. Their advantage is mainly seen in low density (3.9-4.2 g/cm3), high specific yield strength and stiffness, good oxidation and ignition resistance, combined with good creep properties up to high temperatures. Particularly at temperatures between 600 °C and 800 °C $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys are superior to Ti-based alloys in terms of their specific strength. Compared to the heavier Ni-based alloys below 800 °C, their specific yield strength is at least similar. Therefore, the particular constitution and extremely fine microstructure of these alloys are illustrated by several high-resolution transmission electron micrographs. The mechanical properties seem to be largely affected by the evolution of internal stresses and off-stoichiometric deviations of the majority $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase. Novel experimental approaches are described that could characterize the relevant deformation mechanisms. The combination of these results with the concepts of continuum mechanics and continuum thermodynamics has allowed developing models to describe thermomechanically controlled processes. A selection of such models is introduced and explained in a comprehensive way. While early modeling attempts were successfully undertaken to elucidate selected aspects of physical metallurgy of Ti-Al alloys, many experimental findings, particularly for modern multi-phase alloys based on $\gamma$(TiAl) with rather complex constitution and microstructure are still waiting for explanation.},

@article{Groh2009,
abstract = {This paper describes a numerical, hierarchical multiscale modeling methodology involving two distinct bridges over three different length scales that predicts the work hardening of face centered cubic crystals in the absence of physical experiments. This methodology builds a clear bridging approach connecting nano-, micro- and meso-scales. In this methodology, molecular dynamics simulations (nanoscale) are performed to generate mobilities for dislocations. A discrete dislocations numerical tool (microscale) then uses the mobility data obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations to determine the work hardening. The second bridge occurs as the material parameters in a slip system hardening law employed in crystal plasticity models (mesoscale) are determined by the dislocation dynamics simulation results. The material parameters are computed using a correlation procedure based on both the functional form of the hardening law and the internal elastic stress/plastic shear strain fields computed from discrete dislocations. This multiscale bridging methodology was validated by using a crystal plasticity model to predict the mechanical response of an aluminum single crystal deformed under uniaxial compressive loading along the [4 2 1] direction. The computed strain-stress response agrees well with the experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) model has been developed to investigate the indentation size effect (ISE) of aluminium single crystal during nano-indentation. The simulated results have been validated by comparison with experimental observations. The load-hardness curves from simulation are consistent with the experimental results. The mathematic relationship between load and indentation depth has been built to investigate indentation size effect. In addition, the Mises stress, critical resolved shear stress, stress and shear strain rates for a selected element and the lattice curvature have been studied to explain indentation size effect.},

@article{Liu2018,
abstract = {This paper presents a multiscale modeling framework based on microscale crystal plasticity theory and macroscale element-free methodology for computational simulation of polycrystalline metals. The element-free method employs an improved moving least squares (IMLS) shape function in the Ritz procedure for computational simulation. In the multiscale modeling scheme, the macroscale strain increments of polycrystalline metals are solved by the element-free method and transferred into the mesoscale grains through a scale transition law, and further transferred into the microscale slip systems through the Schmid's law. The shear strain increments of all grains are then summed up and averaged to calculate the macroscale plastic strain increment. Functions of the temperature-related hardening parameters of the slip systems are determined by calibrating with experimental data. Then, tensile tests are performed on polycrystalline sheets to study their deformation behavior at elevated temperatures. The plasticity of polycrystalline sheets is found to be significantly affected by the grain size. The concentration of shear stress and additional hardening are occurred at the grain boundaries of soft and hard grains. Moreover, it is revealed that the yield strength of the polycrystalline sheets is greatly reduced as the hardening parameters and thermal softening factor decrease at elevated temperatures.},
