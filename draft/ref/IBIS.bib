abstract = {Indentation induced plastic zone size was studied using electron channelling contrast imaging in polycrystalline Fe. Nanoindentation tests were carried out in samples that were compressed to different degrees of thickness reduction. Both strain hardening and residual stresses induced by the compression contributed to significant hardness elevations at all levels of thickness reduction. By comparing between the un-deformed and pre-deformed samples, texture and strain hardening effect were found to contribute to the differences between stresses at micro and macro scales. A correction for texture effects applied to average micro-stresses brought their values close to the macro-stresses. For each sample, a linear relationship was found between the cube of the plastic zone size measured and the inverse of the hardness. The slope of the linear trend line was shown to increase with increased compressive macro-stress level as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). This newly discovered empirical relationship demonstrated the potential of predicting macro-scale residual stress levels from nanoindentation experiments.},

@article{You2017,
abstract = {In this study, the residual stress relaxation behaviour occurring during low-cycle fatigue in shot-peened specimens with either a flat or a notched geometry has been studied. A representative low-pressure steam turbine material, FV448, was used. The residual stress and strain hardening profiles caused by shot peening were measured experimentally and were then incorporated into a finite element model. By allowing for both effects of shot peening, the residual stress relaxation behaviour was successfully simulated using this model and correlated well with the experimental data. Although more modelling work may be required to simulate the interaction between shot peening effects and external loads in a range of notched geometries, the model predictions are consistent with the specimens tested in the current study. The novelty of this study lies in the development of such a modelling approach which can be used to effectively simulate the complex interaction between shot peening effects and external loads in notched regions. Compared with the un-notched geometry, the notched geometry was found to be more effective in retaining the improvement in fatigue life resulting from shot peening, by restricting the compressive residual stress relaxation during fatigue loading.

abstract = {Laser shock peening can improve the damage tolerance of metallic materials by introducing deep compressive residual stress that inhibits crack initiation and growth. This study investigates the laser peening of aluminium alloy in a product form – an extruded T-section – that has different crystallographic textures in different locations. The alloy studied is Al 2099, an aluminium-lithium alloy that shows anisotropy in the mechanical properties when texture is present. Specimens extracted from different regions of the extrusion were laser shock peened with a power density of 3 GW/cm2in single shocks as well as in a pattern. Residual stresses were characterized primarily using incremental hole drilling. The results show 20{\%} higher residual stresses in the web area of the extrusion compared to the flange after peening with a single laser shock, with this difference decreasing as the number of shocks increases. This effect can be explained by the difference in yield strength between those locations. No significant differences were observed in the residual stresses from peening onto different planes of a textured sample at a given location.},

@article{Bolshakov1996,
abstract = {The finite element method has been used to study the behavior of aluminum alloy 8009 during elastic-plastic indentation to establish how the indentation process is influenced by applied or residual stress. The study was motivated by the experiments of the preceding paper which show that nanoindentation data analysis procedures underestimate indentation contact areas and therefore overestimate hardness and elastic modulus in stressed specimens. The NIKE2D finite element code was used to simulate indentation contact by a rigid, conical indenter in a cylindrical specimen to which biaxial stresses were applied as boundary conditions. Indentation load-displacement curves were generated and analyzed according to standard methods for determining hardness and elastic modulus. The simulations show that the properties measured in this way are inaccurate because pileup is not accounted for in the contact area determination. When the proper contact area is used, the hardness and elastic modulus are not significantly affected by the applied stress.},

@article{Ling2010,
abstract = {In this paper, mechanical properties of Nickel film under residual stress have been systematically examined by finite element method in nanoindentation. It was found that load-displacement curves shifted under elastic residual stress and residual stress exceeded the yield stress for fixed indentation depth. Indentation profiles changed monotonously with compressive and tensile stresses at peak force which determinates contact area observed directly by finite element modeling (FEM). The elastic residual stress has an effect slightly on the hardness but residual stress exceeded the yield stress shows a remarkable effect in nickel film. The hardness increased when residual stress exceeded the yield stress increased under tensile and compressive stress applied to specimen. The relationship between residual stress and hardness was linear. It was found that residual stresses didn't affect elastic modulus whether elastic residual stress or plastic stress was applied to specimen. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Chinese Society for Metals.},

@article{LIU2007,
abstract = {Laser shock peening (LSP) is an innovative surface treatment method that can result in significant improvement in the fatigue life of many metallic components. The process produces very little or no surface profile modification while producing a considerably deeper compressive residual stress layer than traditional shot peening operations. The work discussed here was designed to: (a) quantify the fatigue life improvement achieved by LSP in a typical high strength aircraft aluminium alloy and (b) identify any technological risks associated with its use. It is shown that when LSP conditions are optimal for the material and specimen configuration, a 2014three to four times increase in fatigue life over the as-machined specimens could be achieved for a representative fighter aircraft loading spectrum when applied at a representative load level. However, if the process parameters are not optimal for the material investigated here, fatigue lives of LSP treated specimens may be reduced instead of increased due to the occurrence of internal cracking. This paper details the effect of laser power density on fatigue life of 7050-T7451 aluminium alloy by experimental and numerical analysis.},

@article{Tsui1996,
abstract = {The influence of applied stress on the measurement of hardness and elastic modulus using nanoindentation methods has been experimentally investigated using special specimens of aluminum alloy 8009 to which controlled stresses could be applied by bending. When analyzed according to standard methods, the nanoindentation data reveal changes in hardness with stress similar to those observed in conventional hardness tests. However, the same analysis shows that the elastic modulus changes with stress by as much as 10{\%}, thus suggesting that the analysis procedure is somehow deficient. Comparison of the real indentation contact areas measured optically to those determined from the nanoindentation data shows that the apparent stress dependence of the modulus results from an underestimation of the contact area by the nanoindentation analysis procedures.},

@article{Taljat2004,
abstract = {Finite element modeling has been used to study the development of pile-up during indentation with a rigid sphere as it relates to the measurement of mechanical properties by load and depth sensing indentation. A wide range of materials with different elastic moduli, yield stresses, strain-hardening exponents, and friction coefficients were examined. Results show that during a significant portion of the spherical indentation process, the amount of pile-up cannot be related solely to the strain-hardening exponent, as is often assumed. Rather, after initially sinking-in at small depths of penetration, the pile-up for many materials evolves and increases gradually as the indenter is driven into the material. Even when deformation enters the fully developed plastic stage, the pile-up geometry continues to change in manner that can significantly affect the contact area. It is also shown that contact friction affects the pile-up geometry, and that the pile-up heights before and after the indenter is unloaded can be quite different. Implications for the measurement of mechanical properties by load and depth sensing indentation methods are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
