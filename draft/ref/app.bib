abstract = {High-resolution transmission microscopy has been used to reveal the defect processes occurring during shot peening of a high-strength titanium aluminide alloy with a nearly lamellar microstructure. Deformation is characterised by intensive dislocation glide and mechanical twinning, involving all potential slip systems available in the $\alpha$2(Ti3Al) and ?(TiAl) phases. The outermost surface layer consists of extremely fine crystals that are probably a contaminant titanium nitride phase, embedded into an amorphous phase. The mechanisms involved in this mechanically driven solid state transformation will be elucidated. Particular emphasis is paid on the thermodynamic and kinetic factors involved in the amorphisation reaction.},

abstract = {The role of vacancies in work hardening and fatigue of TiAl alloys was investigated by mechanical testing and TEM examination of deformed samples. The evolution of the dislocation glide resistance during straining and after recovery was analysed in terms of thermodynamic glide parameters. Strain path change tests with respect to temperature and recovery experiments were performed in order to characterize the thermal stability of the produced defect structures. The recovery of the deformation induced defect structure was observed by TEM in situ heating experiments. The recovery kinetics is described on the basis of a recently published simulation study of vacancy annihilation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Intermetallic titanium aluminide alloys based on the ordered face-centred tetragonal $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase represent a good example how fundamental and applied research along with industrial development can lead to a new and innovative class of advanced engineering materials. After almost three decades of intensive R{\&}D activities $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys have matured from "laboratory curiosities" to novel structural light-weight materials which eventually found their applications in aerospace and automotive industries. Their advantage is mainly seen in low density (3.9-4.2 g/cm3), high specific yield strength and stiffness, good oxidation and ignition resistance, combined with good creep properties up to high temperatures. Particularly at temperatures between 600 °C and 800 °C $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys are superior to Ti-based alloys in terms of their specific strength. Compared to the heavier Ni-based alloys below 800 °C, their specific yield strength is at least similar. Therefore, the particular constitution and extremely fine microstructure of these alloys are illustrated by several high-resolution transmission electron micrographs. The mechanical properties seem to be largely affected by the evolution of internal stresses and off-stoichiometric deviations of the majority $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase. Novel experimental approaches are described that could characterize the relevant deformation mechanisms. The combination of these results with the concepts of continuum mechanics and continuum thermodynamics has allowed developing models to describe thermomechanically controlled processes. A selection of such models is introduced and explained in a comprehensive way. While early modeling attempts were successfully undertaken to elucidate selected aspects of physical metallurgy of Ti-Al alloys, many experimental findings, particularly for modern multi-phase alloys based on $\gamma$(TiAl) with rather complex constitution and microstructure are still waiting for explanation.},

abstract = {Phase decomposition and ordering reactions in {\^{I}}²/B2-phase containing TiAl alloys were utilized to establish a novel, previously unreported, type of laminate microstructure. The characteristic constituent of this microstructure are laths with a nanometer-scale substructure that are comprised of several stable and metastable phases. Microstructural control can be achieved by conventional thermomechanical processing and leads to a structurally and chemically very homogeneous material with excellent mechanical properties. The physical metallurgy of this novel type of alloy has been assessed by transmission electron microscope investigations and mechanical testing. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

@article{Paul2017,
abstract = {The aim of this study was to gain an insight into the development of near-surface stress, which has been proposed to play a role in environmental embrittlement, as a function of depth after exposure. Investigations were performed, using both energy and angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction, to determine the residual stress as a function of depth for flat specimens made from two $\gamma$-based TiAl alloys in as-polished and exposed (700 °C/1 h/air) conditions. It has been found that large compressive stresses are present at the surface of as-polished specimens due to sub-surface deformation that remains despite careful grinding/polishing. After exposure the compressive residual stresses at depths below 0.6 $\mu$m are significantly reduced, probably due to the annealing out of deformation induced defects, but remain compressive in nature. However, within 0.6 $\mu$m from the outer surface, tensile stresses were present and reached a maximum of around +350 MPa at 0.15 $\mu$m depth. The extent to which the development of superficial tensile residual stress and reduced deeper compressive stress contribute to embrittlement remains unclear.},

abstract = {The effect of local deformation on the fracture behaviour of TiAl alloys was investigated. Roller indentations impressed parallel to the crack plane significantly improve the fracture toughness. The residual strains present in the indentation zone were characterized by X-ray diffraction and modelled using finite element (FE) calculations. The experimentally observed macrostrains exhibit remarkable crystallographic anisotropies and are unequally shared between the major alloy constituents. The mechanisms behind the observed toughening have been discussed in terms of the residual strains and factors improving the crack tip plasticity. With regard to intended high-temperature applications, the temperature retention of the toughening effect was studied.},

@article{Hoppe2014,
abstract = {Long-range internal back stresses developed during room temperature tensile deformation of titanium aluminide alloys have been determined. Dip tests were implemented during the strain-controlled tensile deformation and the resulting sample deformation was monitored in the relaxation regime of the machine. The internal stress was determined as the critical stress at which the inelastic sample relaxation is reversed, i.e. going from the tensile direction to the compression direction. The investigation involves a wide range of alloy compositions with a corresponding variation in the strength properties. For the alloys investigated, the internal stress is about 80{\%} of the yield stress. The mechanical tests were coupled with electron microscopy examination of the defect structure in order to assess the strain accommodation occurring during deformation. Possible sources for the built up internal stresses are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The formation energy of narrow dipolar configurations and the activation energy during their evolution are unraveled. We show that faulted dipoles can be stable over experimental timescales, in full agreement with high-resolution observations. Such stable atomic-scale structures provide a strengthening effect significantly larger than the elastic prediction, which deeply influences plasticity in TiAl.},
