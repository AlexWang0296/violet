abstract = {Foreign object damage (FOD) in gas turbine engines occurs due to the ingestion of small inorganic particles (small stones and sand particles). The damage caused to the blade leading edge may lead to premature crack initiation and ultimately blade failure due the action of time-varying tensile loads. The problem of evaluating the severity of FOD and the induced reduction of component life was investigated in the laboratory, by reproducing the damage conditions accurately and subjecting the impacted blade to fatigue loading simulating the service conditions. One particular aspect of post-FOD analysis focuses on the evaluation of residual stresses in the vicinity of the notch. Residual stresses play an important r{\^{o}}le in controlling the rate of crack initiation and propagation, and may be responsible for accelerated crack growth if they are tensile ahead of the incipient crack, or can cause retardation otherwise. The present study was aimed at experimental and numerical investigate the magnitude and spatial variation of residual stresses in this region. Experimentally, a gas gun was used to introduce the damage by firing a hardened steel cube "point first". Following impact the residual stresses were evaluated using two different experimental techniques involving X-ray diffraction: laboratory low energy monochromatic stress measurement, and high-energy white beam synchrotron stress measurement. The results are compared with the numerical model of the impact phenomenon that was constructed for a selected portion of the blade material, and from which the residual stress pattern following simulated impact was calculated using Bammann damage material model. Both sets of experimental measurements are critically compared with the numerical result, and the relationship between them is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Publishing Ltd. A novel loading method is proposed to remove the effect of residual stress on measured fatigue crack growth rate in welded joint, using which the influence of empirical crack growth rate correlation equations on the results can be avoided. The total stress intensity factor range and the effective stress ratios corresponding to the combined effect of applied and residual stress are kept constant during the fatigue crack growth test, by changing the applied maximum and minimum loads with the increase of crack length and changes in residual stress based on the superposition rule. The feasibility of the proposed method was validated by tests of compact tension specimens containing residual stresses introduced by four-point bending. The loading method was then applied to a test of welded compact tension specimen with coupled effect of residual stress and microstructure change on fatigue crack growth rate. The fluctuation in the separated crack growth rate reflects the effect of microstructure change on fatigue crack growth rate.},

abstract = {This paper investigated the fatigue life of a dissimilar welded joint between SAF2205 duplex stainless steel and 304 austenite stainless steel. A nonlinear fatigue damage model based on continuum damage mechanics (CDM) is used to estimate the fatigue life, and the effect of the residual stress is studied. The results show that large residual stresses were generated in the dissimilar welded joint and agree well with the indentation measurement results. The fatigue test specimens were cut from the welded sample, and the residual stress relaxed significantly after longitudinal cutting, especially for longitudinal residual stress. Considering the transverse residual stress, the estimated fatigue life is more consistent with the experiment. The residual stress mainly affects the mean stress, rather than the stress amplitude. As the longitudinal residual stress relaxed significantly after cutting, the effect of welding residual stress on fatigue life can be seriously overestimated. The width of fatigue test specimen should be at least 30{\%} of the as-weld sample for fatigue design in consideration of the residual stress relaxation.},

abstract = {The three-part paper deals with energy-minimal multiple crack propagation in a linear elastic solid under quasi-static conditions. The principle of minimum total energy, i.e. the sum of the potential and fracture energies, which stems directly from the Griffith's theory of cracks, is applied to the problem of arbitrary crack growth in 2D. The proposed formulation enables minimisation of the total energy of the mechanical system with respect to the crack extension directions and crack extension lengths to solve for the evolution of the mechanical system over time. The three parts focus, in turn, on (I) the theory of multiple crack growth including competing cracks, (II) the discrete solution by the extended finite element method using the minimum-energy formulation, and (III) the aspects of computer implementation within the Matlab programming language. The Part-II of our three-part paper examines three discrete solution methods for solving fracture mechanics problems based on the principle of minimum total energy. The suitability of each solution approach is determined by the stability property of the fracture configuration at hand. The first method is based on external load-control. It is suitable for stable crack growth and stable fracture configurations. The second method is based on fracture area-control (or length-control in 2D). This method is applicable to stable or unstable fracture growth but the fracture front must be stable. The third solution method is based on a gradient-descent. Although the method is aimed at solving general crack growth problems, its weak point is that the converged solution cannot be guaranteed to be optimal in the particular case of competing crack growth and an unstable fracture front configuration. Nonetheless, the main focus is on the implementation and application of the gradient-descent solution approach within the framework of the extended finite element method. Concerning the aforementioned case of competing crack growth, an alternative solution strategy is pursued to supplement the gradient-descent approach. The proposed method, however, is only a proof of concept since its robustness is assessed by solving fabricated benchmark problems. The open-source Matlab code, documentation and example cases are included as supplementary material.},

abstract = {As dislocation emission is regarded as the critical point of brittle-to-ductile transition of fracture mechanism and the defects interact with domain walls motions due to their self-stress fields, the investigations on dislocation forces, especially the interaction force and the reaction between domain switching and dislocations, are the most important fundamentals of dislocation slip in the brittle-to-ductile transition and the pinning effect on domain wall motion mechanisms. In this paper, an innovative method base on the strain nucleus simulated by an assembly of four dislocations and the Green's function integration is used to solve generalized stress field arising from domain switching. Then, the accurate expressions of the interaction forces, pinning forces and the image forces on dislocation are obtained and analyzed. At last, the lattice resistance is also discussed. The numerical results show that the dislocation emission is possible when temperature and load are proper, and the domain switching interaction force is the main driving force of dislocation slip in ferroelectric material under negative electric field load. The curve and equation of the lattice resistance correlated with temperature can also be fitted by the results of the proposed analytical method and corresponding experiments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

In such magnesium alloys, the solute atoms, e.g., silver, manganese and zinc atoms, create adhesive interactions between magnesium atoms. Closed-shell and covalent-like bonding of these types of solute atoms would influence strong adhesion, which impedes the nucleation of a new surface at the twin boundary.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Publishing Ltd. Under pressurized thermal shock (PTS), once crack initiation occurs in a reactor pressure vessel (RPV), the stress concentration around the crack tips may result in local instability and crack propagation. The temperature-dependent material properties are introduced into the finite element analysis model. According to the response of the transient temperature field and stress field near the crack tip region, the influence of PTS on the carrying capacity of the structure is demonstrated. Also, the process of crack initiation and propagation is simulated by using the extended finite element method (XFEM). The results show that the crack of mode I is easy to be initiated on the nozzle in the initial high temperature and high pressure working state. The effect of cladding on the RPV integrity is enhanced with the increase of crack size, and it mainly depends on the crack length. During the PTS transient, a discontinuity of stress exists near the cladding-base interface, and the cladding bears more loading than the base of the same size. As the unloading of the internal pressure, the stress does not decline due to the strong thermal shock. In the late stage of the PTS process, the internal pressure caused by repressurization poses a challenge to the strength of the structure. With the decrease of the base wall thickness, the allowable repressure value also gradually decreases. However, the increase of the base wall thickness causes the rise of thermal stress, and the allowable repressure load is not significantly improved.},

Furthermore, the microcracks almost propagated along the 45{\"{i}}¿½ angle with the tensile direction to Ti layer rather than Al layer.

This paper presents a crystal plasticity model to predict the tensile response and crack initiation in a mixed ferrite-martensite material with a low volume fraction of pro-eutectoid ferrite, representative of a welding-induced intercritical heat-affected zone. It is shown that small volume fractions of ferrite can have a significant effect on material strength and ductility depending on the ferrite grain orientation. For relatively "soft" ferrite grains, microcracks can grow across interferrite ligaments with damage accumulating in the ferrite, leading to a reduction in strength and strain hardening, but with little influence on ductility; in contrast, relatively "hard" ferrite grains act to accelerate microcrack initiation, leading to reduced ductility, with negligible influence on strain hardening up to the maximum load.},

abstract = {The interaction between a type-I blunt crack and a near-tip void were modeled by the two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (2-D DDD), with special emphasis on the void growth, crack-tip deformation and their size effect. Different from the classical crystal plasticity-based FE modeling, the present 2-D DDD modeling clearly indicates that, even for the type-I opening crack, the horizontal slip bands connecting the crack tip and the void surface are easily formed, especially when the ligament between the crack-tip and void surface is not too long. Besides the horizontal slip bands, some asymmetric slip bands which are at an oblique angle to the horizontal x-axis can also be formed and intersect with the micro-void. On two coupled parallel slip bands, some oppositely signed dislocations, which can be regarded as equivalent prismatic dislocation loops, glide toward the void/crack-tip surface and thus drive the void growth and the crack tip further blunting. In addition, the size effect by ligament length and void radius on void growth and crack-void interaction has also been investigated carefully. It was found that the size effect is closely related to the formation of horizontal shear slip bands. There exists a critical void radius, under which the near-tip void tends to change into a flat shape and its area decreases gradually with increasing the applied stress intensity factor (SIF) K. These results might be helpful for a better understanding of the fracture and damage mechanisms in the crack-tip process zone.},

The numerical simulation method employed for the GTAW process of investigated aluminum material was validated experimentally using the hole drilling method as well. High residual stresses were found around the weld line and HAZ area which can increase the risk of crack initiation and propagation in this region of welded aluminum cylinder. Hence in the second part of this research, a longitudinal semi-elliptical crack was considered in the wall of aluminum cylinder subjected to combined internal pressure and torsional loads and its mixed mode I/II fracture parameters (i.e. KI, KII and T) were determined numerically along the crack front and for different crack geometries. Finally the influence of obtained residual stress field on the computed fracture parameters was reanalyzed using the coupled residual stress/mechanical loading applied to the cylinder.

abstract = {Whether a stressed material fractures by brittle cleavage or ductile rupture is determined by its ability to convert elastic strain energy to plastic deformation through the generation and motion of dislocations. Although it is known that pre-existing dislocations play a crucial role in crack tip plasticity, the involved mechanisms are unclear. Here it is demonstrated by atomistic simulations that individual pre-existing dislocations may lead to the generation of large numbers of dislocations at the crack tip. The newly generated dislocations are usually of different types. The processes involved are fundamentally different for stationary cracks and propagating cracks. Whereas local crack front reorientation plays an important role in propagating cracks, the multiplication mechanism at stationary cracks is connected with cross-slip in the highly inhomogeneous stress field of the crack. Analysis of the forces acting on the dislocations allows to determine which dislocations multiply and the slip systems they activate. These results provide the necessary physical link between pre-existing dislocations and the generation of dislocations at crack tips. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Crack healing in ceramics, however, is limited to micro-sized cracks and requires elevated temperatures (above 1000°C) and long time periods even up to 100h. In this work we report on accelerated crack healing of a Ti2SnC ceramic which is capable to repair thermal shock induced cracks at a relatively low temperature of 800°C within only 1h. After healing treatment both the low flexural strength and electrical conductivity measured on the damaged material after quenching were almost fully recovered. Furthermore, Ti2SnC exhibits repeatable healing capability which offers a high potential for developing durable ceramics with prolonged lifetime under harsh thermal conditions.},

abstract = {Friction stir welding (FSW) is being explored as a potential tool for manufacturing aluminum aerospace structures. Several joint configurations, butt, lap and fillet joints have been made in the production of such exploratory structures. Research work on S-N fatigue and fatigue crack growth in the weld zone is required to provide an understanding and tools to assess the damage tolerance issues in friction stir welded joints and structures. In this work, results of a study conducted on near-threshold fatigue crack growth in friction stir welded aluminum alloy 7050-T7451 and a titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V are presented. Tests were conducted on weld coupons as a function of specimen geometry (compact tension, eccentrically loaded single edge and center-crack tension) and stress ratio to understand the effects of residual stresses in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of the alloy. Residual stresses were measured on samples machined from the friction stir welded plates prior to testing. The crack growth results show that residual stresses play a key role in the crack growth parallel to the weld-path in the HAZ. Although friction stir welding process induced low residual stresses in the welds, they are found to produce large effects on the near-threshold fatigue crack growth. In general, the magnitude of the shift in the fatigue threshold in the friction stir welded coupons is a function of microstructure, residual stresses and specimen geometry. However, for a constant microstructure, fatigue thresholds at low stress ratios, were specimen geometry dependent. The thresholds were either higher or lower than those of the parent material. At high stress ratio, the differences due to the specimen geometry vanish. Stress ratio studies show that the center-crack tension geometry is less sensitive to the residual stress effects compared to the compact tension geometry. Crack growth analysis using equivalent residual stresses was used to determine the residual stress intensity factor and predict stress ratio effects. The role of microstructure on the fatigue threshold in the welds is also discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Experimental investigation was conducted to evaluate the fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth characteristics in selective laser-melted titanium 6Al-4 V materials as a follow-on to a previous study on high cycle fatigue. For both the fracture toughness and crack growth evaluation, the compact tension specimen geometry was used. It was found that the fracture toughness was lower than what would be expected from wrought or cast product forms in the same alloy. This was attributed to the rapidly cooled, martensitic microstructure, developed in the parts. At low stress ratios, the crack growth rates were faster than in wrought titanium but became comparable at higher ratios. The fracture toughness appears to be higher when the crack is oriented perpendicular to the build layers. The difference in the average threshold and critical stress intensity values for the crack growth results for the three orientations was within the scatter of the data, so there was essentially no difference. The same was true for the empirically derived Paris Law constants. Residual stresses were likely to have overshadowed any variation in crack growth because of microstructural directionalities associated with build orientation.},

This study investigates the tendency of Co-based WC + NiCr composite layers to cracking during the laser cladding process. Residual stress distributions of the specimen are measured using neutron diffraction and elucidate the correlation between the residual stress and the cracking in three types of cylindrical specimens; (i) no cladding substrate only, (ii) cladding with 100{\%} stellite{\#}6, and (iii) cladding with 55{\%} stellite{\#}6 and 45{\%} technolase40s. The microstructure of the clad layer was composed of Co-based dendrite and brittle eutectic phases at the dendritic boundaries. And WC particles were distributed on the matrix forming intermediate composition region by partial melting of the surface of particles. The overlaid specimen exhibited tensile residual stress, which was accumulated through the beads due to contraction of the coating layer generated by rapid solidification, while the non-clad specimen showed compressive. Also, the specimen overlaid with 55 wt{\%} stellite{\#}6 and 45 wt{\%} technolase40s showed a tensile stress higher than the specimen overlaid with 100{\%} stellite{\#}6 possibly, due to the difference between thermal expansion coefficients of the matrix and WC particles. Such tensile stresses can be potential driving force to provide an easy crack path ways for large brittle fractures combined with the crack initiation sites such as the fractured WC particles, pores and solidification cracks. WC particles directly caused clad cracks by particle fracture under the tensile stress. The pores and solidification cracks also affected as initiation sites and provided an easy crack path ways for large brittle fractures.},

Additive manufacturing technologies are increasing in importance for aerospace and medical applications, where the demand for a fundamental understanding and predictability of static and dynamic material properties are high. Ti-6Al-4V is the most widely used and studied alloy for this technology, and is the focus of this work in its Extra Low Interstitial (ELI) variation. The layered manufacturing of metallic components by EBM creates a unique directional microstructure, and consequently, anisotropic properties. Microstructure evolution, and its influence on mechanical properties of the alloy in the as-fabricated condition, has been documented by various researchers. However, fatigue crack propagation and the effects of the directional structure have not been sufficiently studied, imposing a barrier for this technology's potential extension to high-integrity applications. In this study, fatigue crack growth (FCG) both parallel and perpendicular to the build directions was studied for different stress ratios and crack growth stages. The interaction between the directional as-fabricated EBM microstructure and FCG was investigated and compared to that of the equiaxed $\beta$ annealed microstructure obtained by annealing above the $\beta$ transus temperature. The FCG threshold, $\Delta$Kth, was analytically modeled for the two relative crack propagation directions at different stress ratios, and FCG microstructural mechanisms were established for all three regions of crack propagation.},

abstract = {The understanding of how materials fail is still today a fundamental research problem for scientist and engineers. The main concern is the assessment of the necessary conditions to propagate a crack that will eventually lead to failure. Nevertheless, this kind of analysis tends to be more complicated, when a prior history in the material is taken into consideration and it will be extremely important to recognize all the factors involved in this process. In this work, a numerical simulation of the introduction of residual stresses, which change the crack initiation conditions, in a modified compact tensile specimen to change the condition of crack initiation is presented. Four numerical analyses were carried out; an initial evaluation was performed in a specimen without a crack and it was used for the estimation of a residual stress field produced by an overload; three more cases were simulated and a crack was introduced in each specimen (1 mm, 5 mm and 10 mm, respectively). The overload was then applied to set up a residual stress field into the component; furthermore, in each case the crack compliance method (CCM) was applied to measure the induced residual stress field. By performing this numerical simulation, the accuracy of the crack compliance method can be evaluated. On the other hand, elastic-plastic finite element analysis was utilized for the residual stress estimation. The numerical analysis was based on the mechanical properties of a biocompatible material (AISI 316L). The obtained results provided significant data about diverse factors, like; the manner in which a residual stress field could modify the crack initiation conditions, the convenient set up for induction of a beneficial residual stresses field, as well as useful information that can be applied for the experimental implementation of this research. ?

abstract = {Dynamic crack growth is analysed numerically for a plane strain block with an initial central crack subject to tensile loading. The continuum is characterized by a material constitutive law that relates stress and strain, and by a relation between the tractions and displacement jumps across a specified set of cohesive surfaces. The material constitutive relation is that of an isotropic hyperelastic solid. The cohesive surface constitutive relation allows for the creation of new free surface and dimensional considerations introduce a characteristic length into the formulation. Full transient analyses are carried out. Crack branching emerges as a natural outcome of the initial-boundary value problem solution, without any ad hoc assumption regarding branching criteria. Coarse mesh calculations are used to explore various qualitative features such as the effect of impact velocity on crack branching, and the effect of an inhomogeneity in strength, as in crack growth along or up to an interface. The effect of cohesive surface orientation on crack path is also explored, and for a range of orientations zigzag crack growth precedes crack branching. Finer mesh calculations are carried out where crack growth is confined to the initial crack plane. The crack accelerates and then grows at a constant speed that, for high impact velocities, can exceed the Rayleigh wave speed. This is due to the finite strength of the cohesive surfaces. A fine mesh calculation is also carried out where the path of crack growth is not constrained. The crack speed reaches about 45{\%} of the Rayleigh wave speed, then the crack speed begins to oscillate and crack branching at an angle of about 29° from the initial crack plane occurs. The numerical results are at least qualitatively in accord with a wide variety of experimental observations on fast crack growth in brittle solids. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} IMechE 2016.Failure in steel weldments operating at high temperatures often occurs in the heat-affected zone adjacent to the weld. Such failures can be a result of material inhomogeneity within the heat-affected zone and in the case of tempered martensite steels have been linked with regions of untransformed $\alpha$ (ferrite) phase or over-tempered martensite within the intercritical region of the heat-affected zone. In this work, two-dimensional Voronoi tessellation is used to construct polygonal Voronoi cells to represent the microstructure of the heat-affected zone of a weld in a tempered martensite steel. The Voronoi construction is treated as a representative volume element of the material and is discretised by 8-node linear brick elements, with periodic boundary conditions. The lattice orientation at each material point is specified by three Euler angles, which are assumed to be randomly distributed, to represent the initial lack of texture in the intercritical region of the heat-affected zone. The constitutive response is represented by a nonlinear, rate-dependent, finite-strain crystal plasticity model. The results indicate that small amounts of ferrite can induce significant enhancements in stress and inelastic deformation at the interface of the ferrite and martensite grains. This localisation of stress and strain may be critical for microcrack and/or void formation and may be a contributory factor to Type IV cracking.},

abstract = {A review is presented of the experimental data on subcritical crack growth in geological materials. The main parameters describing subcritical crack growth are the critical stress intensity factor Kc, the subcritical crack growth limit Ko, and the stress intensity factor-crack velocity (K-v) relationship between Ko and Kc. The K-v data are presented in terms of an equation in which the crack velocity depends on stress intensity factor raised to a power n because this is common practice in experimental studies. These data are presented as tables and in synoptic diagrams. For silicates the value of n increases as the environment becomes depleted in hyroxyl species and with increase in the microstructural complexity of the solid. Values of n as low as 9.5 have been found for tensile cracking of quartz in basic environments and as high as 170 for tensile cracking of basalt in moist air. Insufficient experimental data are available to predict subcritical crack growth behavior at depth in the earth's crust without major extrapolations of the data base. Schematic outlines are presented, therefore, of the probable influence on subcritical crack growth of some key parameters in the crustal environment. These include stress intensity factor, temperature, pressure, activity of corrosive environmental agent, microstructure, and residual strains. In addition, a discussion is presented of the likely magnitude of the subcritical crack growth limit. For stress corrosion tensile crack growth of quartz a limit of approximately 0.2 of the critical stress intensity factor is inferred from theoretical calculations. Further problems discussed with regard to the extrapolation of experimental data to crustal conditions include the choice of a suitable equation to describe crack growth and the magnitude of parameters in these equations. A brief discussion of the double torsion testing method is presented in order to aid the interpretation of experimental results because it is almost the sole method used to study subcritical cracking in rocks.},

Emphasis is put on obtaining the best ductility, since the focus is on face centered cubic materials. Finally, a strong effect of the plastic model on the dynamics and on the secondary slip (intensity and localization), beyond the influence of the initial distribution of sources and obstacles, is reported.},

The interest for AM is high and during the past decade a lot of research has been carried out in order to understand the influence from process parameters on the microstructure and furthermore on the mechanical properties. In the present study laser metal wire deposition of Ti-6Al-4V has been studied in detail with regard to its fatigue crack propagation characteristics. Two specimen orientations, parallel and perpendicular to the deposition direction, have been evaluated at room temperature and at 250 °C. No difference in the fatigue crack growth rate could be confirmed for the two specimen orientations. However, in the fractographic study it was observed that the tortuosity varied between certain regions on the fracture surface. The local crack path characteristic could be related to the alpha colony size and/or the crystallographic orientation. Moreover, large areas exhibiting similar crystallographic orientation were observed along the prior beta grain boundaries, which were attributed to the wide alpha colonies frequently observed along the prior beta grain boundaries.},

Three specimen orientations relative to the build direction as well as two different post-build heat treatments were considered. Specimens and test procedures were designed in accordance with ASTM E399 and ASTM E647 standard. The results show that there is a strong influence of post-build processing (heat treated versus 'as built') as well as specimen orientation on the dynamic behaviour of SLM produced Ti6Al4V. The greatest improvement in properties after heat treatment was demonstrated when the fracture plane is perpendicular to the SLM build direction. This behaviour is attributed to the higher anticipated influence of tensile residual stress for this orientation. The transformation of the initial rapidly solidified microstructure during heat treatment has a smaller beneficial effect on improving mechanical properties.},

@article{Salvati2017,
abstract = {The introduction of an overload or underload within a constant amplitude loading fatigue test leads to a retardation or acceleration of the Fatigue Crack Growth Rate (FCGR). The understanding of the causes of these effects is essential in the context of variable amplitude fatigue loading, since in principle any loading history can be represented as a sequence of overloads and underloads. In the case of overload, along with some other minor causes, the residual stress changes at the crack tip and crack closure behind the tip can be thought of as the main factors that affect the fatigue crack growth rate. Whilst this has been recognised and accepted for many decades, controversy persists regarding the relative significance and presence of these two effects, and consensus is yet to emerge. The effect of crack closure, when the baseline loading ratio is high enough, can be inhibited so that the main cause of retardation becomes doubtless the residual stress present ahead the crack tip. In the present paper we report our attempt to deconvolve the contributions of crack closure and residual stress on crack retardation following an overload. To accomplish this task we analyse the results of fatigue tests run at two baseline load ratios, namely R=0.1 and R=0.7. At the load ratio of R=0.7 the crack closure effect is not operative, as confirmed by Digital Image Correlation analysis of the crack flanks close to the tip, and post mortem fractographic analysis of crack surfaces. Therefore, for R=0.7 the compressive residual stress region created by the overload ahead of the crack tip is the sole mechanism causing crack retardation. Therefore, for R=0.7 the focus must be placed entirely on the strain field around the crack tip. To this end, line profiles along the crack bisector of elastic strain in the crack opening direction were collected at several stages of crack propagation past the overload using in situ Synchrotron X-ray Powder Diffraction (SXRPD) technique. By performing comparison between the two loading conditions (R=0.7 and R=0.1), information was extracted regarding the role of residual stress alone, and then, by subtracting this effect for the R=0.1 sample, for crack closure alone. To enable this analysis, we propose a introducing the concept of equivalent effective stress intensity factor range, ∆Keq,effproposed by Walker. Afterwards, the SIF range reduction ratio, $\beta$, which represents the “knock down” factor with respect to the steady state growth was assessed. It is in terms of these newly introduced parameters that the magnitude and extent of the overload-induced crack growth rate retardation can be plotted, fitted and decomposed into closure and residual stress effects, respectively. It is concluded that although the residual stress effect is present at all values of the load ratio R, its effect is relatively short-lived, whilst the closure effect that is dominant at low values of R causes longer range retardation.},

abstract = {Arc-length methods based on Newton–Raphson (NR) iterative numerical solvers are indispensable in non-linear mechanics to trace the equilibrium curves of systems with snap-back or snap-through behaviours. An example is a crack propagating in a rubber-like solid, which can generate extremely sharp snap-backs when the elastic energy is released. A standard arc-length solver satisfies the arc-length constraint which only limits the increment in displacements and in load level to a fixed amount. Thus, it cannot guarantee the satisfaction of the energy balance in the rate form. This work proposes an arc-length based on the J-integral, and assumes the Griffith balance as a constraint equation. Firstly, a fracture criterion (critical load and direction of crack increment) is formulated, consistent with the thermodynamic principle of maximum dissipation: a crack propagates in the direction of the maximum strain energy release rate. For this purpose, this paper provides an explicit and simple expression of the J-integral for varying angles. This fracture criterion does not require the computation of mixed mode Stress Intensity Factors, or asymptotic solutions or derivatives of the tangent stiffness matrix. By doing so, it is shown that the proposed method easily reconciles with the theory of Configurational Forces. Secondly, because of the explicit expression of J provided in this paper, it is easy to linearize the discretized equations of motions consistently. The method proves able to handle very sudden snap-backs occurring under large strains, and both brittle and ductile crack propagation. A particular example of such behaviour is kirigami (paper-cuts) structures made of graphene. The proposed arc-length can capture, for these structures, the transitions from brittle to ductile crack propagation for the same crack patterns, but different pre-crack lengths.},

The current work was conducted as part of a larger America Makes funded project to begin to examine the effects of process variables on the microstructure and fracture and fatigue behavior of AM Ti-6Al-4V. In the fatigue crack growth tests, the fatigue threshold, Paris law slope, and overload toughness were determined at different load ratios, R, whereas fatigue precracked samples were tested to determine the fracture toughness. The as-deposited material exhibited a fine-scale basket-weave microstructure throughout the build, and although fracture surface examination revealed the presence of unmelted powders, disbonded regions, and isolated porosity, the resulting mechanical properties were in the range of those reported for cast and wrought Ti-6Al-4V. Remote access and control of testing was also developed at Case Western Reserve University to improve efficiency of fatigue crack growth testing.},

Crack-propagation behavior in the metallic glass was found to be similar to that observed in traditional ductile crystalline alloys (e.g., high-strength steels and aluminum alloys), both in terms the dependence of growth rates on the applied stress-intensity range and in the presence of ductile striations on fatigue fracture surfaces. Conversely, the stress-life behavior of the metallic glass (at R°0) was very different from that observed in the crystalline alloys. Fatigue lifetimes were much shorter in the amorphous alloy and exhibited a far lower dependence on the applied stress range; moreover, no evidence of a fatigue limit could be detected until stress amplitudes dropped below °1/25 of the tensile strength. Given the similarity in crack-growth behavior but the very different stress/life properties, the prime distinction in the cyclic fatigue behavior of ductile crystalline and bulk amorphous metals appears to be that the ease of crack initiation in the metallic glass is far less sensitive to the applied stress},

The principle of compatibility of blunt crack to edge dislocations has been used to evaluate the dislocations number and dimensionless ratio $\alpha$. Numerical results present that the number of edge dislocations first increases and then decreases with increase of zone size ratio of the dislocations zone and none-dislocations zone, but it can be reduced by higher configurations ratio of semi-minor axis and semi-major axis. In addition, it increases with time and tends to be a constant quickly. The normalized multiplier $\alpha$ first increases and then decreases with increase of zone size ratio. In addition, it decreases with time and the increase of crack configurations ratio. Both normalized micro-volume SED and normalized dislocation-volume SED decrease with increase of distance from crack tip and tend to vanish. But the dislocation-volume SED decreases more quickly than micro-volume SED does, because of its stronger singularity. Moreover, they increase with time and decrease of configurations ratio. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany We examine the contribution of crack bridging and surface elasticity to the elastic interaction between a finite crack and an edge dislocation. The surface effect on the crack faces is incorporated by using the continuum-based surface/interface model of Gurtin and Murdoch. The crack faces are subjected to both normal and shear bridging forces, and the bridging stiffnesses are allowed to vary arbitrarily along the crack. The residual surface tension is taken to be zero in our discussion. The Green's function method is utilized to reduce the boundary value problem to three first-order Cauchy singular integro-differential equations, which are solved numerically by combining the Chebyshev polynomials and the collocation method. A general formula is derived for calculating the image force acting on the edge dislocation. Our analysis indicates that the stresses exhibit both the weak logarithmic and the strong square root singularities at the crack tips. We note that both crack bridging and surface elasticity influence the magnitude and direction of the image force acting on the edge dislocation. Particularly, the results show that the dislocation may have four stable and two unstable equilibrium positions due to the presence of surface elasticity. In addition, the number and location of the equilibrium positions depend on both surface elasticity and crack bridging.},

A multiscale model synthesis approach was used to integrate three elemental models of (i) macroscopic finite element analysis, (ii) geometries and spatial distributions of ferrite grains and pearlite colonies, and (iii) crack initiation and growth. The required input data consisted of only (i) microstructural information, (ii) monotonic tensile properties, and (iii) test conditions. Model validation was performed by comparing the experimental results using steels with various volume fractions of pearlite phases and grain sizes. The predicted fatigue lives and limits were in good agreement with the experimental data for all the steels. In addition, the model could accurately simulate the crack growth behavior observed by optical microscopy. The framework of the proposed model may serve as a basis for predicting the fatigue lives of metallic structural materials.},

abstract = {Shielding effect and emission criterion of a screw dislocation near an interfacial blunt crack are dealt with in this paper. Utilizing the conformal mapping technique, the closed-form solutions are derived for complex potentials and stress fields due to a screw dislocation located near the interfacial blunt crack. The stress intensity factor on the crack tips and the critical stress intensity factor for dislocation emission are also calculated. The influence of the orientation of the dislocation and the morphology of the blunt crack as well as the material elastic dissimilarity on the shielding effect and the emission criterion is discussed in detail. The results show that positive screw dislocations can reduce the stress intensity factor of the interfacial blunt crack tip (shielding effect). The shielding effect increases with the increase of the shear modulus of the lower half-plane, but it decreases with the increase of the dislocation azimuth angle. The critical loads at infinity for dislocation emission increases with the increase of emission angle and curvature radius of blunt crack tip, and the most probable angle for screw dislocation emission is zero. The present solutions contain previous results as special cases.},

In the static compression test, compression residual stress was created near the center of the ball indentation mark. However, in the dynamic impact test, tensile residual stress was created near the center of the ball indentation mark and compression residual stress was created outside of the indentation. Furthermore, the tensile residual stress in the center of the first ball indentation mark changed to compressive stress as the density of the ball indentations surrounding the first ball indentation mark increased. Therefore, the compressive residual stress created by shot peening is considered to be the result of the superposition of residual stress produced by surrounding shots. {\textcopyright} 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Structurally, laminated composite was designed to stack periodically with Ti(Al) and B4C layers. The results of XRD and EDS suggested that laminated structure restrained the interfacial reaction between Ti and B4C phase by confining the contacting area between Ti and B4C layers on interface. As expected, the fracture toughness of the laminated composite reaches to 9.22 ± 1.12 MPa m1/2, which increased by approximately 201{\%} compared with monolithic composite (4.58 ± 0.81 MPa m1/2). This remarkable improvement of fracture toughness was attributed to multiple-layers structure, ductile Ti layers and crack deflection. Thus, laminated structure is a promising approach to produce high toughens metal/ceramic composites.},

abstract = {After tensile overloading during fatigue crack growth, retardation of the crack growth rate was significant. Neutron diffraction was employed to examine the evolution of crack-tip residual stress fields during constant-amplitude cyclic loading and during fatigue crack growth following the overload. It was found that the tensile overload induces larger compressive residual stress and zone size near the crack tip in the crack-growth and crack-opening direction. For the maximum crack growth retardation, the largest compressive residual stresses were measured in the region between an overloading point and the current propagating crack tip, for all three of the orthogonal directions. Such large compressive residual stresses in the crack-wake region are thought to reduce the crack tip driving force, thereby retarding the crack propagation rate significantly. Residual stress mapping was performed to examine the effect of the fatigue stress state on the residual stresses in the three different regions from the centerline to the surface, along the through-thickness direction in the compact-tension specimen. Much larger compressive residual stresses were measured at the surface than at mid-thickness. It is thought that larger compressive residual stresses at the surface result from the plane stress condition, resulting in a slower fatigue crack growth rate at the surface of the specimen.},

Two crystallographically symmetric crack orientations are considered where plane-strain plastic deformation is achieved by the nucleation and glide of edge dislocations on three effective slip systems. A cohesive surface ahead of the initial crack tip, endowed with the universal binding law, allows for the crack to grow. Simulations are carried out in an incremental way, using the superposition of the singular fields of dislocations in an anisotropic half-space and image fields that enforce boundary conditions and the cohesive properties. Considering a wide range of DDP parameters, i.e. source and obstacle densities, the dependence of fracture characteristics on these parameters is demonstrated. The crack growth resistance is found to be orientation-dependent and slightly smaller if the elastic anisotropy of the crystal is taken into consideration. Investigations of plastic dissipation and dislocation density evolution reveal that the dislocation structure evolving around the crack tip plays a key role in the fracture process. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Nanotwinned metals are a class of hierarchically structured materials that appear to transcend the limits of conventional material systems by exhibiting an exceptional combination of superior strength, ductility and resistance to fracture, fatigue, and wear. Recently, we reported a type of necklace dislocations in nanotwinned metals which become operative when the twin boundary (TB) spacing falls below a few nanometers. Here, we show that the presence of a cracklike defect as the dominant dislocation source could allow the same mechanism to operate at much larger twin spacings. This finding calls for further theoretical and experimental investigations of a new type of TB related dislocation mechanism which may play particularly important roles in crack-tip deformation in nanotwinned metals.},

The solid is specified by its Young's modulus,E, Poisson's ratio, v, initial tensile yield stress, $\sigma$Y,and strain hardening exponent,N. The primary parameters specifying the traction-separation law of the fracture process are the work of separation per unit area, $\Gamma$0, and the peak traction, $\sigma${\&}{\#}x030C;gs. Highly refined calculations have been carried out for resistance curves, KR($\Delta$a), for plane strain, mode I growth in small-scale yielding as dependent on the parameters characterizing the elastic-plastic properties of the solid and its fracture process.

Three applications of the results are made : to predict toughnesss when the fracture process is void growth and coalescence, to predict the role of plasticity on interface toughness for similar materials bonded together, and to illuminate the role of plasticity in enhancing toughness in dual-phase solids. The regime of applicability of the present model to ductile fracture due to void growth and coalescence, wherein multiple voids interact within the fracture process zone, is complementary to the regime of applicability of models describing the interaction between a single void and the crack tip.

First, three different loading sequences including one proportional loading and two non-proportional loading paths are applied to the modified boundary layer (MBL) model under small-scale yielding conditions. For the same external displacement field applied at the outer boundary of the MBL model, the mode I K field and T-stress field combined as the different loading paths are applied to investigate the influence of the nonproportional loading. The results show that for either the compressive or tensile T-stress, the loading path which applied K field first followed by T-stress field generates the lower crack-tip constraint comparing to proportional loading. There is only minor difference between the results from proportional loading path and that with the T-stress field applied first following by K field. Next, two finite width specimens under non-proportional biaxial loading conditions that generate the same three loading paths are analyzed. Similar crack tip characteristics are observed in these specimens as these obtained from the MBL model, and it is demonstrated that the near-tip behavior in specimens can be predicted accurately using the results from MBL models. The present results show that it is very important to include the load sequence effects in elastic-plastic fracture analysis when dealing with nonproportional loading conditions.},

The ballistic FOD impacts were introduced by impacting a cube edge head-on (at an angle of 0°) to the leading edge.

abstract = {A physics-based analytical model to assess residual stresses in additive manufacturing made of metallic materials is presented and validated experimentally. The model takes into consideration the typical multi-pass aspect of additive manufacturing. First, the thermal signature of the process is assessed by predicting the temperature for the problem of a moving heat source, then, the thermally induced stresses in a homogenous semi-infinite medium are determined. Taking the thermal stresses as input, the residual stresses are calculated analytically to obtain the distribution across the depth. Good agreement is obtained between the analytical prediction and X-ray measurements made on Selective Laser Melted 316L Stainless Steel. In addition, the analytical approach enables in-depth interpretations of results with basis in the true mechanisms of the process. Thus, the present model appears as a promising tool for optimization of process parameters in additive manufacturing, which in turn will improve the understanding of process parameters and their effect on properties of the final product. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

To this aim Ti3SiC2coatings prepared at different plasma powers (33 and 34 kW) were investigated comparatively under fretting. The results showed that the amount of Ti3SiC2phases was higher at the lower plasma power, leading to a major difference on fretting wear properties. Coatings with a higher content of Ti3SiC2phases exhibited a remarkable decrease in the friction coefficient and an enhancement in the wear resistance. The enhanced wear resistance was mainly attributed to the healed cracks by selective oxidation of Ti3SiC2. The reduced friction coefficient was strongly related to the formation of tribo-induced oxides.},

abstract = {A material is intrinsically ductile under Mode I loading when the critical stress intensity KIefor dislocation emission is lower than the critical stress intensity KIcfor cleavage. KIeis usually evaluated using the approximate Rice theory, which predicts a dependence on the elastic constants and the unstable stacking fault energy $\gamma$usffor slip along the plane of dislocation emission. Here, atomistic simulations across a wide range of fcc metals show that KIeis systematically larger (10–30{\%}) than predicted. However, the critical (crack tip) shear displacement is up to 40{\%} smaller than predicted. The discrepancy arises because Mode I emission is accompanied by the formation of a surface step that is not considered in the Rice theory. A new theory for Mode I emission is presented based on the ideas that (i) the stress resisting step formation at the crack tip creates “lattice trapping” against dislocation emission such that (ii) emission is due to a mechanical instability at the crack tip. The new theory is formulated using a Peierls-type model, naturally includes the energy to form the step, and reduces to the Rice theory (no trapping) when the step energy is small. The new theory predicts a higher KIeat a smaller critical shear displacement, rationalizing deviations of simulations from the Rice theory. Specific predictions of KIefor the simulated materials, usually requiring use of the measured critical crack tip shear displacement due to complex material non-linearity, show very good agreement with simulations. An analytic model involving only $\gamma$usf, the surface energy $\gamma$s, and anisotropic elastic constants is shown to be quite accurate, serves as a replacement for the analytical Rice theory, and is used to understand differences between Rice theory and simulation in recent literature. The new theory highlights the role of surface steps created by dislocation emission in Mode I, which has implications not only for intrinsic ductility but also for crack tip twinning and fracture due to chemical interactions at the crack tip.},

Different types of cyclic slip irreversibilities in the bulk that eventually lead to the initiation of fatigue cracks are discussed. Examples of trans- and intercrystalline fatigue damage evolution in the low cycle, high cycle and ultrahigh cycle fatigue regimes in mono- and polycrystalline face-centred cubic and body-centred cubic metals and alloys and in different engineering materials are presented, and some microstructural models of fatigue crack initiation and early crack growth are discussed. The basic difficulties in defining the transition from the initiation to the growth of fatigue cracks are emphasized. In ultrahigh cycle fatigue at very low loading amplitudes, the initiation of fatigue cracks generally occupies a major fraction of fatigue life and is hence life controlling.},

Crack growth rate and trajectory are examined before and after the crack tip crossing an interface between the WAAM and wrought alloys. The study has focused on the microstructure and residual stress effect. First, the differences in crack growth rate and path between WAAM and wrought alloys are attributed to their different microstructure; the equiaxed wrought alloy has straight crack path, whereas the WAAM lamellar structure causes tortuous crack path resulting in lower crack growth rate. Second, based on measured residual stress profile in the as-built WAAM piece, retained residual stress in the much smaller compact tension specimens and its effect on crack growth rate are calculated by the finite element method. Numerical simulation shows considerable residual stress in the test specimen and the stress magnitude depends on the initial crack location and propagation direction in relation to the WAAM-wrought interface. Residual stress is released immediately if the initial crack is in the wrought substrate; hence it has little effect. In contrast, when crack grows from WAAM to wrought, residual stress is retained resulting in higher stress intensity factor; hence greater crack growth rate.},

However, this has rarely been connected to mechanical twins. In this study, deformation twinning, which is popular in the fatigue crack tip plastic zone of $\alpha$/$\beta$ titanium alloys with the Widmanstatten microstructure, was systematically investigated with the electron backscatter diffraction technique. With the propagation of the fatigue crack, large-scale twins were generated due to the periodic loading and the crystallographic feature of the Widmanstatten microstructure, and they ultimately consumed the major volume of the parent $\alpha$ colony. Twin development with various ranks of Schmid factors (SF) was characterized, while ordinary deformation twins with relatively high rank SF grew most, extraordinary twins with very low rank SF were also activated, although restricted by the ordinary twins. The occurrence of extraordinary twins (including primary and secondary twins) was mainly attributed to the non-uniform local stress distribution induced by the plastic deformation compatibility between the neighboring units. Lastly, the influence of deformation twinning on the mechanical properties concerning crack propagation in hexagonal $\alpha$-Ti alloys was discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} SAGE Publications. The interface effect of a nano-inhomogeneity on the elastic-plastic fracture behavior of a crack with the influence of nearby edge dislocation is studied by applying the surface/interface stress model. When the inhomogeneity and the crack become nano-sized, the bimaterial interface contributes considerable stresses to the crack surfaces, which are usually ignored in the traditional micro/macro crack problems. With the existence of nano-inhomogeneity, an extra dislocation near the crack may be either absorbed into the crack (so the crack grows bigger) or repelled away by the crack and the inhomogeneity. The Zener-Stroh mechanism is employed to model the nano-sized fracture behavior and the generalized Irwin plastic zone correction is taken to improve the fracture analysis at the crack tips. Using the complex potential functions and distributed dislocation method, the stress intensity factor, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement are evaluated by solving the Cauchy singular integral equations. The numerical examples prove that the values of stress intensity factors, plastic zone size and crack tip opening displacement are sensitive to the interface properties of the current nano-scaled problem, especially when the inhomogeneity is small. When the extra edge dislocation is close to the sharp crack tip, the stress intensity factor increases significantly, which indicates the crack has a potential to absorb the nearby dislocation. Further investigations find that mixed mode loading conditions always induce much higher stress intensity factors, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement comparing to pure mode I loading problem.},

abstract = {Anti-shielding of a crack tip by a dislocation is examined at the atomistic level for a simple geometry to test classical singular-crack and recent cohesive-crack models of crack/dislocation interactions. The atomistic model shows that, as an anti-shielding dislocation approaches the crack tip, it causes less anti-shielding than predicted by the singular-crack model. The trend is qualitatively consistent with predictions of a cohesive-crack model, but the atomistic effect is even larger. The cohesive-crack model is consistent with the atomistic results if a reduced cohesive strength of ∼3.5 GPa is used instead of the actual value of 13 GPa. The difference is shown to be due to the non-linear deformation of material around the crack tip, which cannot be fully represented by a cohesive zone law along the fracture surface. It is then shown that, at the point of fracture, there is a unique traction-displacement cohesive law acting behind the crack tip, independent of the position of the anti-shielding dislocation. The maximum traction of 12.8 GPa and fracture energy of 1.9 J m-2are both in excellent agreement with the values obtained from independent atomistic calculations on this material. Both the shielding and cohesive results have implications for the accurate modeling of fracture processes in metallic materials. {\textcopyright} 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The fretting behaviour of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy was studied in a plain cylinder/plane contact configuration under ambient conditions. Inspired by a fretting map approach, a global quantitative methodology is introduced. The transition from partial to gross slip condition was defined through an energy discontinuity analysis. Dominated by adhesion phenomena, the friction coefficient behaviour at the sliding transition is formalized through pressure dependence formulations. The crack nucleation risk under stabilized partial slip condition is expressed through a closed form applying the Crossland's high cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion. Comparison with experiments concludes that the size effect must be considered. An averaged stress approach, based on the identification of an intrinsic representative damage volume, was developed and confirmed by comparing various loading conditions. Integrating both debris formation and debris ejection mechanisms, an energy wear approach is adapted to formalize the fretting wear response under gross slip conditions. Extending the classical Archard's formalism by considering the friction coefficient and sliding amplitude impacts, this wear energy model displays a very good stability through a wide range of pressure, sliding amplitude and test duration conditions. It is finally discussed how the introduction of a restricted number of "constitutive fretting damage variables" can be transposed in FEM codes to model more complex industrial contacts. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The local stress intensity factor was calculated using the dislocation characters obtained in the observation in this study, indicating that the dislocations observed were mode II shielding type dislocations. {\textcopyright} (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

These overloads were either immediately followed by or preceded by underloads of controlled magnitude. Baseline loading magnitude was designed to induce near-threshold conditions well below the Paris Regime. The fatigue fracture surfaces obtained from the tests were subject to fractographic analysis. The study shows that irrespective of their magnitude, underloads preceding tensile overloads do not affect crack growth rate after the overload. However, if the underload follows an overload, it carries a deleterious effect on retardation, whose magnitude is determined by the extent to which the underload drops below baseline cycling level. In either case, observed effects do not seem to have anything to with crack closure, but rather, are attributable to the effect of underloads on near-tip residual stress during baseline cycling that in turn controls threshold stress intensity range. Post-overload crack closure is reduced by crack-tip blunting, but rapidly recovers.},

The crack propagation rate in vacuum was significantly lower than that in air. The crack propagation rate in argon agreed with that in air in the small crack regime; however, it became similar to that in vacuum in the long crack regime. This indicates that the existence of gases has significant effects in the small crack regime, even if they are chemically inert. These results led us to conclude that, in addition to chemical inactivity, the absence of physical adsorption plays an important role in the retarding effect of vacuum on small crack propagation.},

Utilizing the Muskhelishvili complex variable method, the explicit series form solutions of the complex potentials in the matrix and the inclusion regions are derived. The stress intensity factor and critical stress intensity factor for dislocation emission are also calculated. The influences of the orientation of the dislocation and morphology of the blunt crack as well as the material elastic dissimilarity upon the shielding effect and emission criterion are discussed in detail. As a result, numerical analysis and discussion show that the positive screw dislocation can reduce the stress intensity factor of the crack tip (shielding effect) only when it is located in the certain region. The shielding effect increases with the increase of the shear modulus of the matrix and the curvature radius of the blunt crack tip, but decreases with the increase of dislocation azimuth angle. The critical loads at infinity for dislocation emission increases with the increment of the emission angle and the curvature radius of the blunt crack tip, and the most probable angle for screw dislocation emission is zero. The present solutions contain previous results as the special cases.},

abstract = {Abstract Residual stress is that which remains in a body that is stationary and at equilibrium with its surroundings. It can be very detrimental to the performance of a material or the life of a component. Alternatively, beneficial residual stresses can be introduced deliberately. Residual stresses are more difficult to predict than the in-service stresses on which they superimpose. For this reason, it is important to have reliable methods for the measurement of these stresses and to understand the level of information they can provide. In this paper, which is the first part of a two part overview, the effect of residual stresses on fatigue lifetimes and structural integrity are first summarised, followed by the definition and measurement of residual stresses. Different types of stress are characterised according to the characteristic length scale over which they self-equilibrate. By comparing this length to the gauge volume of each technique, the capability of a range of techniques is assessed. In the se...},

Within soft-oriented grains in a microtextured region, pile-up of a slip band within one grain resulted in the direct transfer of slip into an adjacent similarly oriented grain. In contrast, pile up of dislocations in a soft grain with a ‘hard' oriented neighbour resulted in the activation of few non-connected dislocations in the hard grain, with {\textless}a{\textgreater}-type dislocations being activated and the observation of cross-slip. Whilst a high density of dislocations was present from precipitation of secondary alpha in the retained beta ligaments, a little dislocation interaction was observed between the transformed beta and the primary alpha grains.},

abstract = {Fatigue cracking is one of the main failure modes of asphalt pavement. However, the internal growth of cracks in asphalt binder during the fatigue process is still not well understood, which means that the fatigue mechanism itself remains unclear. In this study, the crack lengths and cracking morphology of three types of asphalt binders were analyzed using image analysis methods. The crack growth rule in the asphalt binder was investigated by combining the use of viscoelastic curves and cross-section images. The mechanisms of the asphalt binders were analyzed and a fatigue failure criterion was then developed. The results demonstrate that fatigue crack propagation can be divided into four stages: an incubation period (Stage I), transition period (Stage II), slow growth period (Stage III), and unstable growth period (Stage IV). In Stage I and Stage II, the binder exhibits unstable flow. In Stage III, damage manifests as Type I hairline cracks. In Stage IV, Type II hairline cracks appear and propagate. The fatigue performance of asphalt binders in Stage I and Stage II under controlled-strain mode and controlled-stress mode is the same when equivalent load levels are employed. Eventually, the demarcation point between Stage III and Stage IV is defined as the fatigue evaluation index. This index is independent of load control mode under the same equivalent load levels.},

An extended interface element, based on the Floating Node Method, is developed to represent delaminations and matrix cracks explicitly in a mesh independent fashion. Crack propagation is determined using an element-based Virtual Crack Closure Technique approach to determine mixed-mode energy release rates, and the Paris-Law relationship to obtain crack growth rate. Crack onset is determined using a stressbased onset criterion coupled with a stress vs. cycle curve and Palmgren-Miner rule to account for fatigue damage accumulation. The approach is implemented in Abaqus/Standard{\textregistered} via the user subroutine functionality. Verification exercises are performed to assess the accuracy and correct implementation of the approach. Finally, it was demonstrated that this approach captured the differences in failure morphology in fatigue for two laminates of identical stiffness, but with layups containing ?deg plies that were either stacked in a single group, or distributed through the laminate thickness.},

Second, fatigue crack growth rates were measured for fully additive manufactured samples, as well as for samples containing an interface between WAAM{\textregistered} and wrought materials. The latter category covers five different scenarios of crack location and orientation with respect to the interface.

abstract = {Saw-toothed chips are formed during machining of hardened steel (HRC∞ 60-63). This paper presents a new analytical approach for modelling the chip formation mechanism in hard-turning. It has been observed that the chip formation starts with initiation of a crack at the free surface of the workpiece which further propagates towards the cutting edge of the tool. The crack soon ceases to grow at a point where severe plastic deformation of the material exists under higher level of compressive stresses. The chip segment caught up between the tool rake face and the crack is pushed out while the material in the plastic region just below the base of the crack is displaced along the tool rake face thus forming saw-toothed chips. The direction of crack initiation and propagation are predicted using the surface layer energy/strain energy density criterion. The maximum value of surface layer energy, Yemaxcan be used to evaluate the angle of crack initiation while the strain energy density criterion predicts the corresponding crack propagation angle. Here, the process of chip formation is considered to be a mixed mode crack problem of Mode I and Mode II. The theoretical predictions are verified by the resultant chip contours obtained experimentally. The predictions made are shown to be in good agreement with those measured experimentally. {\textcopyright} 1996 CIRP.},

abstract = {In this work, results of a study conducted on fatigue crack propagation in friction stir welded AA2050 and the effects of FSW induced residual stresses, as well as changes in the microstructure, are presented. Longitudinal residual stress profiles across butt welded 2050 plates were determined using the cut compliance technique and fatigue crack growth testing was conducted on compact tension specimens machined from the friction stir welds. Tests were performed with the crack propagating nominally perpendicular to the weld and with a constant, applied, cyclic, stress intensity factor. Two different material tempers were investigated and in both cases residual stresses were found to have a major effect on the fatigue crack propagation. It was shown that compressive residual stresses are present in the vicinity of the weld, leading to crack closure and a decrease in the fatigue crack growth rate as the crack approaches the weld. Once in the weld nugget, the crack propagation rate increases. This increase is believed to be linked in part to tensile residual stresses but also to a microstructural effect present when the crack grows through the recrystallized nugget. It was also observed that other closure mechanisms, such as oxide-induced closure may affect the fatigue behavior of the 2050 FSW's. Two methods to predict fatigue crack growth rates in the weld zones were attempted: using the residual stress profiles determined by cut compliance and using the effective stress intensity factor, $\Delta$Keff, obtained during fatigue crack growth testing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many manufacturing processes can induce residual stresses in produced components. These residual stresses influence the mean stress during cyclic loading. The initial residual stresses induced during manufacturing change during fatigue damage. This paper presents a research on the change of residual stress distribution during fatigue crack propagation; the research predicts crack propagation by considering residual stress. An analysis approach for the change in residual stress distribution is established according to the diffusion theory of cavity, which is also used to investigate cracks with different orientations. Experiments are conducted to verify the prediction results of residual stress. A probability density function based on Weibull distribution is established to evaluate the accuracy of predicted residual stress. The influence of residual stress on fatigue crack propagation is considered the effective stress intensity factor range, which is calculated under the combined stress field of applied stress and residual stress. An analysis model of crack propagation is established. Furthermore, the model of crack propagation is used to estimate the velocity of crack propagation for the cases, same as the cases of residual stress prediction. The case studies show that the results are basically identical with the experimental results, indicating that the proposed approach is acceptable.},

abstract = {The effects of compressive residual stress on short fatigue crack growth in Inconel 718 have been investigated. Using two different indentation procedures, controlled plane-strain compressive residual stress fields were applied to short through-thickness cracks, which had been generated by machining away wakes of long cracks that had been grown down to threshold levels at a stress ratio of 0.1. Short fatigue crack growth tests were conducted at stress ratios of 0.1 and 0.7. At a stress ratio of 0.1, the residual stress-free testpieces demonstrated typical short fatigue crack growth behaviour, indicated by a reduction of threshold value and increases in fatigue crack growth rates compared to those of long fatigue cracks. A significant decrease in short crack growth rates was observed within the compressive residual stress region of indented testpieces, together with an increase of threshold values. At a high stress ratio of 0.7, any similar decrease in rate is barely observable. This indicates that the effects of compressive residual stress on short fatigue crack growth are monotonic in sign and could perhaps be simulated by a crack closure approach similar to that applied for long fatigue cracks. However the superposition principle which incorporates the compressive residual stress as a negative stress intensity factor, despite many successful applications to long fatigue cracks, is found to be inappropriate here. Hence one should be cautious when extending such a methodology to short fatigue cracks as it may result in optimistic life estimations.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive atomistic- continuum numerical method for quasi-static crack growth. The phantom node method is used to model the crack in the continuum region and a molecular statics model is used near the crack tip. To ensure self-consistency in the bulk, a virtual atom cluster is used to model the material of the coarse scale. The coupling between the coarse scale and fine scale is realized through ghost atoms. The ghost atom positions are interpolated from the coarse scale solution and enforced as boundary conditions on the fine scale. The fine scale region is adaptively enlarged as the crack propagates and the region behind the crack tip is adaptively coarsened. An energy criterion is used to detect the crack tip location. The triangular lattice in the fine scale region corresponds to the lattice structure of the (111) plane of an FCC crystal. The Lennard-Jones potential is used to model the atom-atom interactions. The method is implemented in two dimensions. The results are compared to pure atomistic simulations; they show excellent agreement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The three-part paper deals with energy-minimal multiple crack propagation in a linear elastic solid under quasi-static conditions. The principle of minimum total energy, i.e. the sum of the potential and fracture energies, which stems directly from the Griffith's theory of cracks, is applied to the problem of arbitrary crack growth in 2D. The proposed formulation enables minimisation of the total energy of the mechanical system with respect to the crack extension directions and crack extension lengths to solve for the evolution of the mechanical system over time. The three parts focus, in turn, on (I) the theory of multiple crack growth including competing cracks, (II) the discrete solution by the extended finite element method using the minimum-energy formulation, and (III) the aspects of computer implementation within the Matlab programming language. The key contributions of Part-I of this three-part paper are given as follows. (1) Formulation of the total energy functional governing multiple crack behaviour. (2) Three solution methods to the problem of competing crack growth for different fracture front stabilities, e.g. stable, unstable, or partially stable crack tip configurations; we compare our approach to Budyn et al. (2004) and demonstrate via example cases that the latter approach of resolving competing crack growth is not energy minimal in some cases. Finally, (3), the minimum energy criterion for a set of crack tip extensions is posed as the condition of vanishing rotational dissipation rates with respect to the extension angles. The proposed formulation lends itself to a straightforward application within a discrete framework involving multiple finite-length crack tip extensions. The open-source Matlab code, documentation, benchmark/example cases are included as supplementary material.},

In this contribution, a Peierls type continuum model developed by Rice (1992, Dislocation Nucleation From a Crack Tip: An Analysis Based on the Peierls Concept, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 40: 239-271) is employed to analyze the critical stress of dislocation emission from the surface notch/crack in the plane strain state in a unified manner. Both the stress field in a notched/cracked half-plane under mode I loading and the stress field induced by an edge dislocation are obtained in closed forms using the Muskhelishvili method. Calculations are carried out to study the effects of the notch/crack depth and the root curvature radius on the dislocation emission. Results show that the critical stress for dislocation emission depends greatly on both of them. The shallower the surface notch/crack is, the higher the critical stress is. This depth dependence of the critical stress for the surface notch is more significant than that for the surface crack. Similarly, the dependence of the critical stress on the slip plane orientation angle for the surface notch is relatively stronger than that for the surface crack. Within a certain range of the slip orientation angle, the critical dislocation emission stress for the surface notch with small root curvature radius is even less than that for the surface crack at the same depth. These results are helpful for us to understand the ductile-brittle fracture behavior of materials with surface notches or cracks.},

abstract = {When Staphylococcus aureus undergoes cytokinesis, it builds a septum, generating two hemispherical daughters whose cell walls are only connected via a narrow peripheral ring. We found that resolution of this ring occurred within milliseconds (“popping”), without detectable changes in cell volume. The likelihood of popping depended on cell-wall stress, and the separating cells split open asymmetrically, leaving the daughters connected by a hinge. An elastostatic model of the wall indicated high circumferential stress in the peripheral ring before popping. Last, we observed small perforations in the peripheral ring that are likely initial points of mechanical failure. Thus, the ultrafast daughter cell separation in S. aureus appears to be driven by accumulation of stress in the peripheral ring and exhibits hallmarks of mechanical crack propagation.$\backslash$nPop goes the coccus$\backslash$nDaughter cell separation in Staphylococcus aureus proceeds much like the cracking of an egg.

Environment also influenced crack initiation lifetime in that cracks initiated earlier in laboratory air than in vacuum or saturated water vapor environments. Transgranular, crystallographic crack growth was observed in each environment, with the crack path in primary $\alpha$ grains producing facets parallel to basal planes when crack size was small.

abstract = {While driven by a combination of stress, a susceptible microstructure and an aggressive environment, the mechanistic origin of stress corrosion cracking remains poorly understood. The emergence of localized deformation as a key process in SCC has resulted in considerable experiment and simulation studies. The effectiveness of irradiation in localizing deformation into dislocation channels has provided a tool for studying the interaction between channels and grain boundaries. Experiment and simulation have shown that normal stress can be in excess of twice the applied stress and that cracking correlates well with the high normal stress. Shear stresses in the channel can add an additional component to the normal stress at the channel-boundary intersection. While the exact role of localized deformation in stress corrosion cracking is not yet full understood, it is known that the degree of localized deformation correlates well with SCC susceptibility. Further, both experiments and simulations indicate that cracks preferentially nucleate in grain boundaries that are perpendicular to the loading direction, are non-special high angle boundaries, are not oriented for easy deformation under the applied load, and are effective barriers to slip transmission. This paper will review recent progress in understanding the behavior of localized deformation and the impact on stress corrosion cracking. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This work presents a generalization of recently developed continuum phase field models from brittle to ductile fracture coupled with thermo-plasticity at finite strains. It uses a geometric approach to the diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a balance equation for a regularized crack surface and its modular linkage to a multi-physics bulk response developed in the first part of this work. This evolution equation is governed by a constitutive crack driving force. In this work, we supplement the energetic and stress-based forces for brittle fracture by additional forces for ductile fracture. These are related to state variables associated with the inelastic response, such as the amount of plastic strain and the void volume fraction in metals, or the amount of craze strains in glassy polymers. To this end, we define driving forces based on elastic and plastic work densities, and barrier functions related to critical values of these inelastic state variables. The proposed thermodynamically consistent framework of ductile phase field fracture is embedded into a formulation of gradient thermo-plasticity, that is able to account for material length scales such as the width of shear bands. It is applied to two constitutive model problems. The first is designed for the analysis of brittle-to-ductile failure mode transition in the dynamic failure analysis of metals. The second is constructed for a quasi-static analysis of crazing-induced fracture in glassy polymers. A spectrum of simulations demonstrates that the use of barrier-type crack driving forces in the phase field modeling of fracture, governed by accumulated plastic strains in metals or crazing strains in polymers, provide results in very good agreement with experiments.},

abstract = {Stress relaxation at a crack tip relies on the material's ability to generate dislocations. Despite the extensive literature devoted to crack-dislocation interaction, no one has yet explained how dislocations appear and multiply in order to build a fully plastic zone. Here we will show how a simple event, such as the intersection of a unique incoming dislocation with a crack front, induces the generation of new dislocations: this effect is called "stimulated emission". Submitted to the applied crack stress field, these dislocations can repeat the stimulation process step by step all along the crack front, through a cross-slip mechanism. Such a rapidly increasing rate of dislocations nucleation leads to a sudden growth of the plastic zone (avalanche). {\textcopyright} 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a novel and innovative production technology that can produce complex and lightweight engineering products. In AM components, as in all engineering materials, fatigue is considered as one of the principle causes of unexpected failure. In order to detect, localise and characterise cracks in various material components and metals, acoustic emission (AE) is used as a non-destructive monitoring technique. One of the main advantages of AE is that it can be also used for dynamic damage characterisation and specifically for crack propagation monitoring. In this research, we use AE to monitor the fatigue crack growth behaviour of Ti6Al4V components under four-point bending. The samples were produced by means of AM as well as conventional material. Notched and unnotched specimens were investigated with respect to the crack severity and crack detection using AE. The main AE signal parameters –such as cumulative events, hits, duration, average frequency and rise time– were evaluated and indicate sensitivity to damage propagation in order to lead to a warning against the final fracture occurrence. This is the first time that AE is applied in AM components under fatigue.},

The specimens were treated by laser shock peening (LSP) to generate compressive residual stresses in the leading edge region prior to impact. FOD was simulated by firing a cubical projectile at the leading edge using a laboratory gas gun at 200. m/s, head-on; and at 250. m/s, at an angle of 45°. The specimens were then subjected to 4-point bend fatigue testing under high cycle (HCF), low cycle (LCF) and combined LCF and HCF loading conditions.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterise the damage features due to FOD. Crack initiation and early crack growth due to FOD and subsequent fatigue growth were examined in detail. The results were compared between the two impact conditions; and with those from samples without LSP treatment as well as those impacted with spherical projectiles. The results seem to suggest that LSP has improved the crack growth resistance post FOD. Delayed onset of crack initiation was observed in LSPed samples compared to those without LSP under similar loading conditions. Damage features depend on the geometry of the projectile, the impact angle as well as the impact velocity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Introduction The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of apical crack initiation and propagation in root dentin after several endodontic procedures. Methods Sixty intact mandibular premolars were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis at 1 mm from the apex, and the apical surface was polished. Thirty teeth were left unprepared and served as a control, and the remaining 30 teeth were instrumented with ProTaper Universal instruments (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) up to size F5. The root canals were filled with the single-cone technique. Gutta-percha was removed with drills of the Rebilda post system (VOCO, Cuxhaven, Germany). Glass fiber-reinforced composite fiber posts were cemented using a dual-cure resin cement. The fiber posts were removed with a drill of the post system. Retreatment was completed after the removal of the gutta-percha. Crack initiation and propagation in the apical surfaces of the samples were examined with a stereomicroscope after each procedure. The absence/presence of cracks was recorded. Logistic regression was performed to analyze statistically the incidence of crack initiation and propagation with each procedure. Results The initiation of the first crack and crack propagation was associated with F2 and F4 instruments, respectively. The logistic regression analysis revealed that instrumentation and F2 instrument significantly affected apical crack initiation (P {\textless}.001). Post space preparation had a significant effect on crack propagation (P =.0004). The other procedures had no significant effects on crack initiation and propagation (P {\textgreater}.05). Conclusions Rotary nickel-titanium instrumentation had a significant effect on apical crack initiation, and post space preparation with drills had a significant impact on crack propagation.},

The breakage process of the disks was studied by inserting single and double cracks with different inclination angles. It was observed that wing cracks are produced at the first stage of loading, and start their propagation toward the direction of compressive line loading.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. Most mechanicians are aware that residual stresses affect fatigue and fracture. Few are aware of the full extent of the effects residual stress have on myriad aspects of those and other structural processes AND of the reverse relationship: fracture concepts are hugely intertwined with residual stress measurements. This talk first reviews the straightforward effect that residual stress has: it acts just like an external load and, depending on the sign, accelerates or retards failure processes. The talk then describes one exemplar less well-known effect: residual stress can make it very difficult to measure true material properties like fracture toughness. The talk then describes the influence of fracture concepts, most notably the mode I stress intensity factor K I , on residual stress measurement. A short and elegant derivation reveals that incremental slitting measurement strain data can be converted to residual stress profiles using a K I analysis and a conceptually simple calibration factor that is independent of the stress distribution. The talk next shows that several error sources for slitting and contour method stress measurements can be directly correlated with the K I caused by residual stress. The talk then lays out Bueckner's superposition principle, the most powerful but misunderstood and mistrusted tool for analyzing stress fields around cracks. Originally developed for fracture mechanics, Bueckner's is used to calculate the K I from residual stresses and to calculate calibration coefficients for hole drilling and slitting. More notably, the contour method for measuring residual stress is a direct experimental embodiment of Bueckner's principle. In fact, we review an experimental demonstration that misfit measurements between mating fracture surfaces can be used to calculate the residual stresses that existed prior to the fracture.},

The basal and pyramidal cracks show brittle cracking and the crack tip stress coincides with the magnitude of the $\sigma$yy=KIC/2$\pi$r in the linear fracture mechanics, despite of the different conditions of single crack vs. periodic crack array. In the basal crack, the principal axes of $\eta$$\alpha$(1){\textless}0 atoms clearly show symmetrical deformation mode against crack plane. The pyramidal crack propagates in the 30° tilted adjacent pyramidal plane, and $\eta$$\alpha$(1){\textless}0 atoms emerge around the crack tip and the corresponding principal axes are often normal to the new crack surface. On the other hand, the prismatic crack shows dislocation emission and tip blunting. $\eta$$\alpha$(1){\textless}0 atoms widely emerge in butterfly shape around crack tip before the stress–strain peak or the onset of dislocation emission. There is no remarkable structural change in these $\eta$$\alpha$(1){\textless}0 region; however, the material property or local stiffness is clearly different from the surrounding media so that the stress distribution on the crack plane remarkably deviates from the continuum theory. The principal axes of these atoms are not in the crystal orientation but in 45° against loading axis; this difference possibly prevents the structural change. The trigger of dislocation emission is captured by the principal axis of $\eta$$\alpha$(1){\textless}0 atoms, which is located on the tip surface and oriented in the slip direction.},

The intermediate size scale where the discreteness of dislocations comes into play is the main origin of the hysteresis needed for fatigue and of the high stresses required for atomistic separation to take place. We focus on recent developments which permit analyses of fatigue crack growth involving the direct coupling of disparate size scales. Although no analyses have been carried out directly coupling size scales from the atomic to the conventional continuum, the ingredients to do so are in place. We provide background that illustrates the key role played by the intermediate discrete dislocation size scale and review steps that have been taken to permit direct size scale coupling.

abstract = {The piping in some residual heat removal (RHR) systems in nuclear power plants, made of 304L stainless steel, is subjected to a multiaxial cyclic stress state in the cold/hot water mixing zone due to thermal fluctuations. In addition, residual stresses produced by welds and/or surface treatments can be large in magnitude and be tensile or compressive, depending on the proximity to the weld location. Crack networks have been observed to nucleate and grow under these stress states. Prominent cracks originating from micro-cracks on the order of grain size continue to grow to a length of about 2.5 mm. The thermal fluctuation is such that crack growth is in the high cycle fatigue regime. In this paper, the plane orientation and growth direction of these cracks with respect to the cyclic and mean stress states and their gradients are analyzed. The roles and interactions of shear, tensile, and compressive stresses with regards to the direction and orientation of the cracks are also discussed. Weld residual stresses (WRS) are decomposed into a local effect in tension near the weld and a structure effect in compression farther away, which also help explain some crack configurations in RHR systems. Moreover, a dependence of WRS field on spatial second derivative of weld temperature field is shown, which can have an important impact for comparison of measured and simulated WRS. Crack growth was also simulated with XFEM in the presence of WRS, with the principal hypothesis that mean stress acts only on crack opening.},

abstract = {Brittle fracture in carbon steel has a strong impact on the safety of the structures. Especially, the arresting technology of the running crack is the measure of last resort for ensuring structural integrity. Due to such high importance, many experimental and theoretical studies of brittle crack propagation have been conducted from both mechanical and microstructural viewpoints. It is thought that the elementary step of the brittle fracture of polycrystalline steel is the cleavage in each crystal grain and their connection process. However, the detailed mechanisms of brittle fracture have not been fully understood; for example, it is still unclear why the propagation rate under a large driving force is not increased up to the Rayleigh wave speed. Several difficulties hinder the achievement of a detailed understanding so far: 1) crack propagation is quite rapid, 2) the crystal grain is usually too small (10–100 $\mu$m) to collect sufficient information, 3) the microstructure is very complicated in most case, i.e., containing different phases, microstructures, precipitates and inclusions. In this study, to eliminate such difficulties, 3{\%} silicon steel in which microstructure is the ferrite single phase and the grain size is increased to 4–5 mm is used. This steel can be fractured in a brittle manner, even under ambient temperature. For this steel, by using a high speed camera and strain gauge data with a high sampling rate, the elementary process of brittle crack propagation is elucidated. As a result, it is revealed that the brittle crack propagation rate even in a single-crystal grain is much slower than the Rayleigh wave speed. This seems to be due to the presence of twin deformations and twin boundary cracks in crystal grain as observed on the fracture surface. Using the analysis of electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) data, the mechanism of twin deformation and twin boundary crack is revealed. Additionally, it is shown that the brittle crack propagation rate where the path includes crystal grain boundaries is much slower. This delay seems to be related to the misorientation angle at the GB. By applying our simplified model, the delay effect at the grain boundary can be successfully explained.},

abstract = {Dislocation interaction with a cohesive crack is of increasing importance to computational modelling of crack nucleation/growth and related toughening mechanisms in confined structures and under cyclic fatigue conditions. Here, dislocation shielding of a Dugdale cohesive crack described by a rectangular traction-separation law is studied. The shielding is completely characterized by three non-dimensional parameters representing the effective fracture toughness, the cohesive strength, and the distance between the dislocations and the crack tip. A closed form analytical solution shows that, while the classical singular crack model predicts that a dislocation can shield or anti-shield a crack depending on the sign of its Burgers vector, at low cohesive strengths a dislocation always shields the cohesive crack irrespective of the Burgers vector. A numerical study shows the transition in shielding from the classical solution of Lin and Thomson (1986) in the high strength limit to the solution in the low strength limit. An asymptotic analysis yields an approximate analytical model for the shielding over the full range of cohesive strengths. A discrete dislocation (DD) simulation of a large ({\textgreater}103) number of edge dislocations interacting with a cohesive crack described by a trapezoidal traction-separation law confirms the transition in shielding, showing that the cohesive crack does behave like a singular crack at very high cohesive strengths (???7 GPa), but that significant deviations in shielding between singular and cohesive crack predictions arise at cohesive strengths around 1GPa, consistent with the analytic models. Both analytical and numerical studies indicate that an appropriate crack tip model is essential for accurately quantifying dislocation shielding for cohesive strengths in the GPa range. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Drill-string fatigue failures are the most common and costly type of failures in Oil {\&} Gas and Geothermal drilling operations. However, the drilling industry currently does not have a means of quantitatively evaluating drill-pipe fatigue fife. The aim of the present study is to fill this gap, providing a rapid and easy means of accurately obtaining drill-pipe fatigue life estimates. The geometry considered is the passage of a drill-pipe through a dogleg. It is characterised by a load combination of tension and bending while undergoing rotation. This load–geometry combination is taken as representative of the present-day drilling. The Stress Intensity Factors along the crack front of a semi-elliptical internal crack in a drill-pipe are obtained by means of Multiple Reference States Weight Function approach that is then implemented in a developed MATLAB code. The developed computer code is validated by comparison with data available in the literature and then applied to the geometry of interest. The Stress Intensity Factors thus obtained are then inserted in the Paris Fatigue Crack Growth Model to quantitatively evaluate the drill-pipe fatigue life. Finally, a parametric study is performed in order to identify the influence of load magnitudes, dogleg, crack shape and geometrical parameters on the fatigue life. A detailed discussion of all these effects concludes the paper. It is the contention of the authors that the method can be easily, rapidly and successfully extended to other oilfield tubulars.},

abstract = {Cracks can occur in the articular cartilage surface due to the mechanical loading of the synovial joint, trauma or wear and tear. However, the propagation of such cracks under different frequencies of loading is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequency of loading on the growth of a pre-existing crack in cartilage specimens subjected to cyclic tensile strain. A 2.26 mm crack was introduced into cartilage specimens and crack growth was achieved by applying a sinusoidally varying tensile strain at frequencies of 1, 10 and 100 Hz (i.e. corresponding to normal, above normal and up to rapid heel-strike rise times, respectively). These frequencies were applied with a strain of between 10–20{\%} and the crack length was measured at 0, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 cycles of strain. Crack growth increased with increasing number of cycles. The maximum crack growth was 0.6 ± 0.3 (mean ± standard deviation), 0.8 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.4 mm at frequencies of 1, 10 and 100 Hz, respectively following 10,000 cycles. Mean crack growth were 0.3 ± 0.2 and 0.4 ± 0.2 at frequencies of 1 and 10 Hz, respectively. However, this value increased up to 0.6 ± 0.4 mm at a frequency of 100 Hz. This study demonstrates that crack growth was greater at higher frequencies. The findings of this study may have implications in the early onset of osteoarthritis. This is because rapid heel-strike rise times have been implicated in the early onset of osteoarthritis.},

The simulation results show that the machining process will introduce interfacial defects inside the specimen and enhance the compressive stress beneath the surface.

Various machining parameters are adopted to investigate their influence on the me- chanical behavior of machined specimen. Lower cutting speed and smaller cutting depth lead to less defects and greater residue compressive stress, which brings about better mechanical properties. The elastic limit increases by 36.8{\%} under the cutting depth of 0.73 nm and decreases by 21.1{\%} under the cutting depth of 1.46 nm.

Three distinct regimes of fatigue crack growth were observed, with different slopes in the da/dN-$\Delta$K curve, attributable to different micromechanisms.

In general, the $\Delta$K{\textless}inf{\textgreater}th{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} of a BMG approximately scales with its fracture toughness.

abstract = {The evolution of dislocation structures was investigated by TEM in Fe?Si alloys with 0, 0.5 and 1.0 mass{\%} Si during a cyclic bending test in conjunction with fatigue crack behavior. The addition of Si in- creased the fatigue strength. The evolution of dislocation structures was significantly influenced by the Si addition. Namely, in the steel without Si the dislocation cell structure develops, whereas in the steel with 1 mass{\%} Si the vein structure develops, which is considered to lead to increased fatigue strength. The dis- location cell structure observed in the steel without Si is postulated to be caused by the easy cross slip of dislocations during cyclic deformation, whereas the vein structure that developed in the steels with Si is in- ferred to be caused by the difficulty in cross slip due to the decrease in stacking fault energy. Furthermore, the Si added steel shows a characteristic structure in a manner such that the dislocations are free in approx- imately 0.5 mm zones along grain boundaries. The examinations of the fatigue fracture surface revealed that transgranular fracture takes place in steel without Si, whereas in steel with 1 mass{\%} Si many intergranular cracks were observed just beneath the top surface. The intergranular cracks in the 1 mass{\%} Si steel were thought to be caused by the fact that a) strains are dispersed within grains owing to the vein structure and b) micro cracks are initiated and propagated along grain boundaries due to the dislocation free zones.},

abstract = {An unsolved problem in the mechanics of fatigue crack growth is why mean stress or stress ratio in a fatigue cycle has a profound effect on growth rate when compared in terms of stress intensity factor range ($\Delta$K). Specifically, there has not been any fracture-mechanically-consistent theory to explain the effects of mean stress on fatigue crack growth. In this work, a new and generalized driving force parameter for fatigue crack growth, which effectively incorporates the mean stress or stress ratio effect, is developed from energy principles of solid mechanics. A successful explanation of the effect of mean stress on the growth rate is provided. The driving force is the accumulated change in net-section strain energy, which develops as a function of increasing crack length and decreasing net-section size in fatigue. A generalized mechanics analysis, showing how to account for the stress amplitude and the maximum stress of a fatigue cycle in the change in net-section strain energy, is presented. Equivalently, the new crack growth parameter can also be interpreted as the cumulative work done by cyclic loading at the crack length at which the crack growth data is determined. Several experimental data, including some historically significant fatigue crack growth data, generated on aluminum, steel and titanium alloys, are used to demonstrate the success of the correlation. As a further validation of the proposed concept, it is shown that the empirical Walker parameter ($\Delta$K0.5Kmax0.5), which had some success in correlating stress ratio effect, is in fact related to the change in net-section strain energy.},

abstract = {Along with external forces and the macro-geometry of cracked bodies, the local stress intensity factors $\Delta$k and kmaxat fatigue crack fronts are also determined by internal stress fields and the crack front microgeometry (extrinsic shielding). This means that a description of the crack-tip stress field by two external (remote) parameters $\Delta$K (Kmax) and $\Delta$T (Tmax) is not sufficient. The paper presents a discrete dislocation model of contact shielding effects in the case of small-scale yielding under plane-strain conditions. The model is physically transparent and, unlike continuum-based models for plane stress, it enables us to directly assess the magnitude of both plasticity and roughness-induced components of crack closure. Moreover, it reflects an influence of microstructure on the roughness-induced term. The closure components can be simply extracted from experimentally measured values of the remote $\Delta$K using standard data on mechanical properties and microstructure. Thus, the effective threshold $\Delta$Keff,thcan be obtained as nearly independent of microstructure coarseness and applied cyclic ratio as shown for several important engineering materials. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The non-propagating fatigue crack observed in the Fe-25Cr-1N steel was produced by roughness-induced crack closure. This phenomenon was caused by the enhanced planar dislocation and high dislocation pile-up stress resulting from the suppression of cross-slip, which inhibited the dislocation emission from the crack tip. The Fe-25Cr-1N steel exhibited a lower fatigue crack growth rate than the Fe-18Cr-14Ni steel because of the enhanced dislocation planarity produced by the Cr-N interaction. The Cr-N interaction affected the fatigue crack growth behavior as follows. The short crack region exhibited a planar glide dislocation pattern, but multiple slip systems were activated as the crack lengthened. As the dislocation pattern remained planar on each slip plane, the crack propagation occurred along the {\{}1 1 1{\}}$\gamma$slip planes, even in the long crack. Moreover, the dislocation pile-up at the grain boundaries caused grain boundary subcracks, which can induce crack toughening through mechanisms such as stress redistribution. These positive effects contributed to the lower fatigue crack growth rate in the Fe-25Cr-1N steel than the Fe-18Cr-14Ni steel.},

The decrease of activation energy may be related to the expansion of local structure around the Re atom when dislocation goes through the Re atom. The calculations also show that the frequency of dislocation nucleation can be improved with the Re addition at 300 or 1500 K, which means that the ductility of crack in Ni may be enhanced by Re.},

The steel was deformed by high-pressure torsion to study the influence of applied strain and specimen orientation on the FCG-behavior. With increasing strain the lamellar structure of the steel is aligned parallel to the shear plane of the HPT-sample and the lamella spacing is markedly reduced. These microstructural changes exhibit a significant influence on the FCG-behavior. The threshold of stress intensity factor range decreases, while at the same time the fatigue crack propagation rate rises with increasing level of pre-deformation. In addition a pronounced anisotropy in the crack propagation behavior depending on the specimen orientation evolves. The observed trends will be explained on the basis of the fading influence of shielding mechanisms and the microstructural alignment of the structure upon deformation.},

The scheme couples molecular dynamics to extended finite element method (XFEM) via the Bridging Domain Method (BDM). This method is based on linear weighting of the strain energy over a region (the bridging domain) which conserves the energy in the entire system. To compute the material behavior in the continuum scale, the Cauchy-Born method is used. Many improvements have been made in the implementation to make the method work for the general case of materials and presence of multi-million degrees of freedom. To show the applicability and productivity of the proposed method, two three dimensional crack examples were modeled. The results show that the method and the corresponding implementation are capable of handling dislocation and crack propagation in the three dimensional space.},

Although yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) ceramics have higher crack resistance than other dental ceramics, their aging susceptibility threatens their long-term performance in aqueous environments such as the oral cavity. Unfortunately, increasing the aging resistance of Y-TZP ceramics normally reduces their crack resistance. Our recently conducted systematic study of doping 3Y-TZP with various trivalent cations revealed that lanthanum oxide (La2O3) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have the most potent effect to retard the aging kinetics of 3Y-TZP. In this study, the crack-propagation behavior of La2O3 and Al2O3 co-doped 3Y-TZP ceramics was investigated by double-torsion methods.

The specimen preparations followed the ASTM E647 instructions for compact tension (CT) specimens.

The results are as follows: (1) The dislocation structure includes misoriented cells next to the crack tips for propagation rates greater than 5×10-5mm/cycle. When the crack propagation rate is less than 5×10-7mm/cycle, the dislocation structure next to the crack tips is dominated by a loop patch structure. (2) When crack tips have the same steady crack propagation rate, the dislocation structures are similar regardless of the load history.

The principle of minimum total energy, i.e. the sum of the potential and fracture energies, which stems directly from the Griffith's theory of cracks, is applied to the problem of arbitrary crack growth in 2D. The proposed formulation enables minimisation of the total energy of the mechanical system with respect to the crack extension directions and crack extension lengths to solve for the evolution of the mechanical system over time. The three parts focus, in turn, on (I) the theory of multiple crack growth including competing cracks, (II) the discrete solution by the extended finite element method using the minimum-energy formulation, and (III) the aspects of computer implementation within the Matlab programming language. The key contributions of Part-III of the three-part paper are as follows: (1) implementation of XFEM in Matlab with emphasis on the design of the code to enable fast and efficient computational times of fracture problems involving multiple cracks and arbitrary crack intersections, (2) verification of the minimum energy criterion and comparison with the maximum tension criterion via multiple benchmark studies, and (3) we propose a numerical improvement to the crack growth direction criterion that gives significant gains in accuracy and convergence rates of the fracture paths, especially on coarse meshes. Finally, the open-source Matlab code, documentation, benchmarks and other example cases are included as supplementary material.},

The macrozone characteristics studied in this paper include the Schmid factors of grains within the macrozone, the misorientation between two macrozones or a macrozone and its adjacent area and the angle of the interface versus loading axis. In this study, fatigue crack was initiated within two adjacent macrozones or within a macrozone and its adjacent region with high Schmid factors. Misorientation crack factors are introduced to combine all the above influencing factors and crack initiation on the interface. Fatigue crack initiation mechanism around macrozones has been studied and discussed. The texture index is introduced as a single value to represent the sharpness of the microtexture of a macrozone.},

The volumetric fraction of internal oxides within the bond coat increased from 5{\%} to 38{\%} during 799 h isothermal exposure at 1150 °C, indicating significant swelling of the internal oxides. This swelling behavior not only significantly increases the thickness of the bond coat layer from 175 $\mu$m to 260 $\mu$m, but also probably elevates the risk of interfacial failure in the TBCs, due to the roughness change at the interface and the huge residual stress generated. Thus, different finite element (FE) models were established to understand the role of the internal oxides in interfacial morphology and residual stress. The internal oxidation behavior was modeled on experimental results. The FE results showed that although the internal oxidation only slightly increased the interfacial roughness, significant changes were found in the patterns of the stress component S22 and the interfacial normal stress along the interface, increasing the risk of micro-cracks and changing the crack locations.},

The pores in the sintered alloy could be classified into two groups; type-I being caused by particle interstices that did not fully close during sintering (sinter-pores) and the type-II originating from larger voids that did not close during powder packing (cave-pores). The fatigue life trends can be classified by the type and the location of pore from which the crack initiated. Interestingly, the two types of pores, and the two different locations (surface versus interior) from which the cracks initiated lead to four distinct S-N trends in the fatigue data. When the stress amplitude level and the pore size were accounted for through initial stress intensity factors, the fatigue data reduced to dual S-N fatigue curves. The results offer new insights into how pores, especially their type and size, and location control the fatigue behavior of PM Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Large improvements in fatigue life can be obtained if the large cave-pores are eliminated or their volume density reduced to very low levels.},

abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of assessment of fatigue crack growth (FCG) of 316LN stainless steel using the acoustic emission (AE) monitoring technique. A new AE parameter, i.e. AE entropy, was used for accurate assessment of fatigue damage and prediction of fatigue crack length. The effects of peak load on both FCG and AE behaviors were also discussed by fractographic observations and AE parameter analyses. The results showed that AE entropy is effective for accurately identifying the point of crack initiation and assessing the fatigue damage during FCG of 316LN stainless steel under high noise loading environment. Moreover, two distinct damage stages were distinguished by the characteristics of AE entropy. The source mechanisms of AE entropy for stage 1 were fatigue crack initiation and small crack growth, while the mechanisms responsible for stage 2 were the plastic activities in plastic zone at the crack tip, the formation of micro-voids and the ligaments shearing between these micro-voids. The results also indicated that AE entropy is available for identifying the transition in stress condition from plane strain to plane stress state of specimens under high peak load. In addition, a probabilistic model based on the quantitative relationship between the crack growth size and cumulated entropy was proposed for prognosis of crack growth. Bayesian inference was used to estimate the model parameters and the posterior predictive distribution of crack length. The predictive results showed that the model could accurately predict the measured crack growth lengths in all cases. The proposed model is applicable to stable long crack growth and can be applied under high noise loading environment.},

abstract = {Total fatigue life performance of high strength titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V manufactured by Additive Manufacturing (AM) based methods such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is of significant interest and has gained much attention recently. Researchers often compare the total fatigue life of materials manufactured from SLM with conventional manufacture, and often the SLM lives are reduced because cracks initiate from “defects” such as porosity or Lack of Fusion (LOF). But for repair and alternative manufacture of complex and critical aerospace structures for example, the crack growth/propagation phase of the fatigue process is also very important and it has not been studied as extensively. The aim of the work presented here was to evaluate and better understand crack propagation under constant amplitude loading in Ti-6Al-4V samples manufactured using SLM with a variety of layer thicknesses and build directions (vertical or horizontal). The “as-manufactured” condition was studied, with no post heat treatment. Cracks typically initiated at LOF features which had a negative impact on the total fatigue life. The focus here was on the crack growth phase. Modelling was performed with a conventional Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics approach using literature data obtained from testing on Compact Tension (C(T)) specimens which were also in the as-manufactured condition with a variety of build directions. The modelling provided a very useful correlation of the data and provided a way of assessing the LOF features in terms of an equivalent initial crack. The crack growth properties of the SLM cases were also compared against literature data for conventionally manufactured material. The work will lead to a better understanding of fatigue crack growth characteristics for components manufactured by AM methods such as SLM. That understanding is an essential requirement for full certification and acceptance into service for critical applications such as aerospace structures.},

Under fatigue loading these two kinds of inherent weaknesses lead to premature failure and consequently fairly low performance in many alloys processed by SLM. The fatigue performance of stainless steel 316L has been investigated. Thorough microstructural analyses were carried out using electronoptical techniques and X-ray diffraction in order to shed light on the process-microstructure-property relationships for this alloy. Fatigue property analyses have not been carried out in such depth so far. The results obtained clearly show that 316L is a promising candidate for cyclically loaded parts manufactured by SLM.

@article{Zhiyuan2018a,
abstract = {The impact crack-closure retrofit (ICR) treatment was applied to cracked specimens. Two fatigue test stages were applied: the first stage was designed to prefabricate the fatigue crack, and the second stage was used to evaluate the retrofitting effect by assessing fatigue life. The stress was monitored through strain gauges during the fatigue test, and the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip was determined by a two-strain-gage technique. The extended finite element method (XFEM) was adopted as a means of acquiring the stress in each specimen, or the SIF, where it is difficult to measure it during the fatigue test. The test results show significant improvement on the delay of crack propagation due to the ICR treatment, as well as the fatigue resistance within cracked areas. Moreover, the cracked section is enhanced when closing the crack surface through the comparison of the stress variation with, and without, crack closure. The SIF at the crack tip decreased by about 36{\%}, slowing down the crack growth rate, according to the fracture mechanics due to the change of crack profile and stress redistribution.},

@article{Prime1999a,
abstract = {This article reviews the technical literature on the determination of a residual stress profile by successive extension of a slot and measurement of the resulting strains or displacements. This technique is known variously in the literature as the crack compliance method, the successive cracking method, the slotting method, and a fracture mechanics based approach. The article briefly summarizes the chronological development of this method and then, to facilitate more detailed review, defines the components that make up the method. The theory section of the article first considers forward method solutions including fracture mechanics, finite element, analytical, and body force methods. Then it examines inverse solutions, including incremental inverses and series expansions. Next, the article reviews all experimental applications of the crack compliance method. Aspects reviewed include the specimen geometry and material, the details of making the slot, the deformation measurement, and the theoretical solutions used to solve for stress. Finally, the article makes a brief qualitative comparison between crack compliance and other residual stress measurement methods. In many situations, the crack compliance method offers several advantages over other methods: improved resolution of residual stress variation with depth; the ability to measure both small and very large parts; measurement of stress intensity factor caused by residual stress; measurement of crack closure stresses; increased sensitivity over other material removal methods; and the ability to measure non-crystalline materials.},

@article{Bahrami2017,
abstract = {By influencing both the interfacial adhesion and the morphology, compatibilizers determine the mechanical properties of polymer blends. Here, we study the mechanical properties, in particular the fatigue crack propagation (FCP) of immiscible blends of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether)/poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (PPE/SAN), compatibilized with Janus nanoparticles (JPs) and linear polystyrene-block-polybutadiene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (SBM) triblock terpolymers. Synergistic effects of a mixture of both compatibilizers improve the FCP behavior and reveal the important role of interface stiffness and flexibility on the mechanical properties of polymer blends. The triblock terpolymer and JPs allow at the same time an elastic and stiff linkage at the blend interface and induce multiple deformation mechanisms such as crack bridging and matrix fibrillation that can dissipate energy and contribute to an improved FCP behavior. The presented concept allows tailoring macro-mechanical properties of immiscible polymer blends by adjusting blend morphology and interfacial properties.},
