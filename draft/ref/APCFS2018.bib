abstract = {Precipitation is an efficient method to strengthen metallic materials. While precipitation hardening effects on dislocation slip have been studied extensively in the past, the influence of precipitates on twinning mediated plasticity and the development of corresponding hardening models that account for twin-precipitate interactions have received less attention. Here, the interaction of {\{}10-12{\}} extension twin boundaries (TBs) in pure magnesium with precipitates of plate-, sphere- and rod-like shapes is studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find that TBs that engulf precipitates are absorbed by the precipitate-matrix interfaces, and the precipitates are neither twinned nor sheared but deform elastically leading to their rotation. TBs can pass small precipitates (length? 20 nm) and remain intact. In contrast when TBs are interacting with large precipitates (length? 50 nm), basal dislocations or stacking faults nucleate from the interfaces, causing local plastic relaxation. The stress field around a plate-like precipitate as calculated in the MD simulations suggests that a strong back-stress is imposed on the TBs. We then coarse grain these mechanisms into an analytical mean field model of precipitation hardening on twinning in magnesium alloys, which is based on the energy conservation during the TB-precipitate interaction. The model is in good agreement with the current MD simulations and published experimental observations. The hardening model shows that spherical precipitates have the strongest hardening effect on twinning, basal and prismatic plate-like precipitates have a medium effect while rod-like precipitates exert the weakest influence. We also find that most types of precipitates show a stronger hardening effect on twinning mediated plasticity than on basal dislocation slip. Finally, prismatic plate-like precipitates are predicted to have reasonable hardening effects on both twinning and basal slip. These results can help guiding the development of magnesium alloys with enhanced strength and ductility.},

abstract = {The glide and climb of dislocations are two important plastic deformation mechanisms of the metallic crystals at elevated temperatures. In this work, a new dislocation density-based constitutive model for single crystal plasticity with explicit consideration of both dislocation glide and climb is presented. Three contributions of dislocation climb to the plastic deformation are involved: the kinematics, the climb-enhanced dislocation mobility and the climb-induced dislocation annihilation. A fully implicit time-integration scheme for this model is given and implemented by a user material subroutine in software ABAQUS. Then, the compression tests of 〈110〉 single crystalline aluminum at high temperature and low strain rate are simulated, showing good agreements with the experimental results. Moreover, this model is used to predict the creep deformation of single crystalline aluminum at different temperatures and applied stress levels. The results show that the present model can capture the power law creep behavior of single crystalline aluminum and the predicted creep exponent falls within the range suggested by earlier research.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Based on the strain rates of 2 × 10 8 s −1 and 2 × 10 10 s −1 , molecular dynamics simulation was conducted so as to study mechanisms of crack propagation in nanoscale polycrystal nickel. The strain rate has an important effect on the mechanism of crack propagation in nanoscale polycrystal nickel. In the case of a higher strain rate, local non-3D-crystalline atoms are induced and Lomer-Cottrell locks are formed, which plays a critical role in crack initiation and propagation. Orientation difference between adjacent grains leads to the slipping of dislocations along the different directions, which results in the initiation of a void near the triple junction of grain boundaries and further contributes to accelerating the crack propagation.},

abstract = {The effect of hydrogen (H) on the interfacial damage in Ni-based single crystal superalloy is investigated by utilizing the molecular dynamics (MD) method. Accompanying the motion of misfit dislocation networks on the $\gamma$/$\gamma$'interphase, more vacancies can form on the $\gamma$/$\gamma$'interface with higher pre-charged H concentration. With the same H concentration, hydrogen-enhanced vacancies can more easily form at a low temperature than a high temperature. Meanwhile, hydrogen can facilitate the reaction and dissociation of interfacial dislocation segments, aggravating subsequent damage of the interfacial dislocation networks. These results shall enrich our understanding on the hydrogen embrittlement of the Ni-based single crystal superalloy.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Experimental results (Huang {\textless}italic{\textgreater}et al{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} .) indicated that nanotwinned diamond (nt-diamond) has unprecedented hardness, whose physical mechanism has remained elusive. In this report, we categorize interaction modes between dislocations and twin planes in nt-diamond and calculate the associated reaction heat, activation energies, and barrier strength using molecular dynamics. On the basis of the Sachs model, twin thickness dependence of nt-diamond hardness is evaluated, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. We show that two factors contribute to the unusually high hardness of nt-diamond: high lattice frictional stress by the nature of carbon bonding in diamond and high athermal stress due to the Hall-Petch effect. Both factors stem from the low activation volumes and high activation energy for dislocation nucleation and propagation in diamond twin planes. This work provides new insights into hardening mechanisms in nt-diamond and will be helpful for developing new superhard materials in the future. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
