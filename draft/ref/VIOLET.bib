abstract = {Micro-indentation has been widely used for testing the mechanical properties of NiTi SMAs. In the present study, large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of nano-indentation on equiatomic NiTi SMA were performed with a 2NN MEAM potential. The temperature- and stress-induced martensitic transformation was simulated, where the phase transformation temperatures were determined and the critical stress for transformation was found to rise with the increase of temperature. The nano-indentation results show that a typical superelasitic recovery occurs during unloading, and the slope of P-L curves increases with the increase of temperature, which can be attributed to the increase of critical stress. The MD simulation results also show that the affect region of phase transformation beneath the indenter tip can be divided into elastic zone, twinned martensitic zone and detwinned martensite zone. Differently orientated martensitic variants appear during loading and most of them recover during unloading. In addition, the influencing region of phase transformation decreases with the increase of temperature and a theoretical explanation was suggested. The morphologies and profiles of indented surfaces were presented, which exhibit sink in during indent and turn into pile-up after unloading once severe plastic deformation occurs during indentation. The MD simulation results are consistent satisfactorily with the experimental results, implying that the present work could lead to a better understanding of the mechanical properties of equiatomic NiTi SMAs at nano-scale.},

abstract = {Brittle fracture in carbon steel has a strong impact on the safety of the structures. Especially, the arresting technology of the running crack is the measure of last resort for ensuring structural integrity. Due to such high importance, many experimental and theoretical studies of brittle crack propagation have been conducted from both mechanical and microstructural viewpoints. It is thought that the elementary step of the brittle fracture of polycrystalline steel is the cleavage in each crystal grain and their connection process. However, the detailed mechanisms of brittle fracture have not been fully understood; for example, it is still unclear why the propagation rate under a large driving force is not increased up to the Rayleigh wave speed. Several difficulties hinder the achievement of a detailed understanding so far: 1) crack propagation is quite rapid, 2) the crystal grain is usually too small (10–100 $\mu$m) to collect sufficient information, 3) the microstructure is very complicated in most case, i.e., containing different phases, microstructures, precipitates and inclusions. In this study, to eliminate such difficulties, 3{\%} silicon steel in which microstructure is the ferrite single phase and the grain size is increased to 4–5 mm is used. This steel can be fractured in a brittle manner, even under ambient temperature. For this steel, by using a high speed camera and strain gauge data with a high sampling rate, the elementary process of brittle crack propagation is elucidated. As a result, it is revealed that the brittle crack propagation rate even in a single-crystal grain is much slower than the Rayleigh wave speed. This seems to be due to the presence of twin deformations and twin boundary cracks in crystal grain as observed on the fracture surface. Using the analysis of electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) data, the mechanism of twin deformation and twin boundary crack is revealed. Additionally, it is shown that the brittle crack propagation rate where the path includes crystal grain boundaries is much slower. This delay seems to be related to the misorientation angle at the GB. By applying our simplified model, the delay effect at the grain boundary can be successfully explained.},

abstract = {An investigation on the effect of aging on the tensile properties and creep behavior of a fully lamellar (FL) Ti-47Al-2Nb-1Mn-0.5W-0.5Mo-0.2Si (at.{\%}) alloy is presented. Aging at intermediate temperatures produces precipitate particles predominantly along $\alpha$2/$\gamma$ lamellar interfaces or within $\alpha$2lamellae. Most of the precipitates are $\beta$-particles with fewer silicides. Aging at intermediate temperatures leads to increased tensile strength as a result of precipitation of $\beta$ and silicide particles. In addition, aging yields an increased primary creep resistance but a shortened creep life for the FL structure. The shortened creep life of the aged FL structures could be a result of early decomposition of $\alpha$2lamellae during creep. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present the orientation dependent indentation response of pure magnesium during single grain indentation. A conical indenter and maximum loads between 50 mN and 900 mN were employed. Indent topographies were acquired by confocal microscopy. The indents were also characterized by electron backscatter orientation microscopy for their microstructures. Pronounced activation of specific twinning systems was observed around the impressions. The resulting data were compiled into the inverse pole figure presentation of indent microstructures and topographies after Zambaldi and Raabe, Acta Mater. (2010). Three-dimensional crystal plasticity finite element simulation of the indentation deformation supports the interpretation of the orientation dependent slip and twinning patterns around the indents. The match between the activation of observed and simulated twinning variants is discussed with respect to the conditions for nucleation and growth of extension twins. Furthermore, the compatibility of the twinning strains with the imposed deformation is discussed based on the expanding cavity model of indentation. The orientation dependent response of magnesium during indentation is compared to the literature data for indentation of alpha-titanium and beryllium. Recommendations are given on how to exploit the characteristic nature of the observed indentation patterns to rapidly assess the relative activity of deformation mechanisms and their critical shear stresses during alloy development.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations Ni-Ti based on a second nearest neighbor modified embedded-atom method potential were performed to study atomic-scale mechanical behavior and microstructural evolution of Ni-Ti alloy at different temperatures. By using four calculated characteristic transformation temperatures, the optimum simulated temperature ranges were determined. At temperatures lower than Ms, a thermally induced self-accommodating martensitic phase consisting of three variants formed. Each of the two variants was twin structures. In the subsequent loading process, the most favorable variant grew with the movement of interfaces among the variants, which produced remnants of the residual strain after unloading. After heating up to over Af, the residual strain disappeared and the shape recovered to the original. The shape memory effect under austenite state was also performed, wherein the sample exhibited a typical stress–strain temperature curve and remained in a martensitic state after unloading. After heating at a high temperature, the martensite transformed back into its parent phase accompanied with the recovery of residual strain. The material exhibited superelastic behavior above Af, and the critical transformation stress increased with increased temperature. Some parts of B2 structures remained at the end of the plateau stage and continued transforming into martensites during the hardening stage for both T {\textgreater} Afand Ms{\textless} T {\textless} Af. The critical stresses for transformation satisfied the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship at T {\textgreater} Ms.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes our recent work on the effects of microstructural features on the mechanical properties of TiAl alloys prepared by powder and ingot metallurgy. TiAl alloys based on Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb (at{\%}) were alloyed with small amounts of Ta, W, and B additions for control of alloy phases and microstructure. The alloys were processed by hot extrusion above and below T$\alpha$, followed by short- and long-term heat treatments at temperatures to 1350 °C in vacuum. The microstructural features in the lamellar structures were characterized by metallography, SEM and TEM, and the mechanical properties were determined by tensile tests at temperatures to 1000 °C. The tensile elongation at room temperature is mainly controlled by the colony size, showing an increase in ductility with decreasing colony size. The yield strength, on the other hand, is sensitive to the interlamellar spacing. Hall-Petch relationships hold well for both yield strength and tensile elongation at room and elevated temperatures. TiAl alloys with refined colony size and ultrafine lamellar structures possess excellent mechanical properties for structural applications at elevated temperatures.},

In situ tensile and fracture toughness tests were performed in vacuum using a high-temperature loading stage in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), while conventional tensile tests were performed in air. The results revealed strong influences of microstructure on the crack-tip deformation, quasi-static crack growth, and the fracture initiation behaviors in the alloy. Intergranular fracture and cleavage were the dominant fracture mechanisms in the duplex microstructure material, whose fracture remained brittle at temperatures up to 600 °C. In contrast, the nearly fully lamellar microstructure resulted in a relatively high crack growth resistance in the 25 °C to 800 °C range, with interface delamination, translamellar fracture, and decohesion of colony boundaries being the main fracture processes. The higher fracture resistance exhibited by the lamellar microstructure can be attributed, at least partly, to toughening by shear ligaments formed as the result of mismatched crack planes in the process zone. {\textcopyright} 1992 The Minerals, Metals  {\&}  Materials Society and ASM International.},

During the compression, the nano-void crystal undergoes elastic then plastic deformation process. In the elastic period, the nano-void shrinks linearly along compression direction while it expands linearly along the directions perpendicular to the compression direction. Finally, the nano-void collapses from all directions at the beginning of the plastic process. The formation and extension of dislocations and the shrinking mechanism of void were analyzed in detail. The dependence of the void shrinking on the specimen size, strain rate, and void volume fraction were also investigated. It is found that the stacking faults' slipping in the crystal during plastic period is the main deformation mechanism of the void shrinkage: dislocation structures initially start to nucleate around the equator area of the void, then partial dislocations and planar faults constantly propagate, finally the stacking faults and partial dislocations swap through the entire system and the void shrinks.},

Our atomistic simulations reveal that, unlike a lattice vacancy, a hydrogen-vacancy complex is not absorbed by dislocations sweeping through the lattice. Additionally, this complex has lower lattice diffusivity; therefore, it has a lower probability of encountering and being absorbed by various lattice sinks. Hence, it can exist metastably for a rather long time. Our large-scale molecular dynamics simulations show that when metals undergo plastic deformation in the presence of hydrogen at low homologous temperatures, the mechanically driven out-of-equilibrium dislocation processes can produce extremely high concentrations of hydrogen-vacancy complex (10-5∼ 10-3). Under such high concentrations, these complexes prefer to grow by absorbing additional vacancies and act as the embryos for the formation of proto nano-voids. The current work provides one possible route for the experimentally observed nano-void formation in hydrogen embrittlement of steels and bridges atomic-scale events and damage with macroscopic failure.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze nanovoid growth in single crystalline vanadium under tension. Radial distribution function at the first nearest neighbor distance was calculated to find out the critical strain rate below which the deformation of specimen was static. Then a tensile stress was exerted on both void contained box and intact box under two constraint conditions. Homogenous dislocations were nucleated in intact box at yield point; while for void contained box with void radius twice the lattice constant, 〈1 1 1〉{\{}1 1 0{\}} shear loops were punched out from void surface. The formation of shear loops was the result of the splitting of purely screw cores on three non-planar planes, as well as their transformations to more stable two-fold non-planar dislocations under tension. The asymmetry of loops was influenced by both strain rate and triaxiality of system. It is also found that, in lower rate cases the yield point and peak stress point coincided; however, the two points separated at higher rate due to the inadequate void growth rate. Mean square displacement of void surface atoms were given out to geometrically depict the void evolution. Moreover, simulations with different initial porosity and box size were performed respectively. It is shown that when void reduced to contain only one vacancy, dislocations can be nucleated independently of the void; when porosity was large enough, the interactions between void and its periodic images were noticeable. Also, when both the void and box were large, triangular prismatic loops on {\{}1 1 0{\}} planes were observed at void surface, which may be contributed to a combined effect of the intersection of shear loops and the ledges along the void surface. Finally, the results of our MD simulations agreed well with that from Lubarda equation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The evolution, growth and coalescence, of nanovoids play a significant role in the plasticity of nanocrystalline metallic materials. Previous atomistic studies of void growth in face centered copper, and other metallic materials, have considered voids in single crystals, and those located at grain boundaries in polycrystals. The evolution of a spherical nanovoid in copper polycrystals under uniaxial tension is the focus of this atomistic investigation. In this paper, a critical stress based criterion is proposed for emission of dislocations from spherical void surfaces. The preference of dislocation source, GBs or spherical void surfaces, is determined by the relative magnitude of the critical stresses to emit dislocations from GBs or spherical void surfaces. The criterion reveals that there exists a grain size dependent critical void diameter at which the dislocation emission transits from GBs to spherical void surfaces as the spherical void grows. Simulation results show that, in intragranular voided models, the critical void diameter is 13 nm for simulation models with a 16.32 nm grain size and is 5.5 nm for simulation models with a 6.92 nm grain size. The critical void diameters revealed by simulations are in agreement with that obtained by the criterion. In addition, the simulation results indicate that the Gurson's model may be extended to predict the global yield conditions for simulation models with intragranular spherical voids. In the simulation models with intergranular voids, the spherical void continuously grows due to the initial dislocation emission from the intersections of GBs and spherical void surfaces.},

abstract = {The tensile behavior of monocrystalline nickel with nano-void was studied via molecular dynamics simulation (MD) considering different lattice orientations. A series of simulations were performed to analyze the effect of system size, void volume fraction and lattice orientation on mechanical properties and microstructure evolution. The influence of size of sample on the incipient yield stress is discussed. The results show that void volume fractions have significant effects on Young's modulus, incipient yield stress and incipient yield strain. Dislocation structure begins to nucleate in the stress concentration area. The critical stress of [1 0 0], [1 1 0] and [1 1 1] orientation is 6.97 GPa, 6.77 GPa and 7.31 GPa, respectively. The results of dislocation propagation and stress-strain responses reveal the elastic-plastic properties of different orientations. The fracture strain is the elongation of the specimen. The elongation of the sample along [1 1 1] orientation is greatest, which illustrate that the sample has good ductility performance along [1 1 1] orientation in the same initial damage. The reaction between the dislocations and the boundary leads to the rearrangement of the boundary atoms, which proves that the dislocation can not be stopped inside the crystal, or closed or terminated at the crystal surface or grain boundary. The difference of the rearrangement of the boundary atoms is due to the difference of the sliding systems of different orientations.},

After irradiations, microchemical changes at the void surfaces and matrices were analyzed by EDS. At temperatures below 573 K, where the effect of long range migration of vacancies is negligibly small, the interstitial loop density in FeCrNiP alloys was considerably higher than that in pure FeCrNi ternaries. This indicates that the addition of phosphorus significantly influences the nucleation of interstitial loops at these temperatures. From the temperature dependence of the loop density, an interstitial-phosphorus binding energy of 0.5 eV was derived. At temperatures above 573 K void swelling or vacancy loop formation is prominent and shifted upward by 100 K. Moreover, solute (Ni) segregation to the void surface and matrix were suppressed by phosphorus addition. Such phenomena are thought to be the result of vacancy-phosphorus interaction. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Sheets made of intermetallic $\gamma$-TiAl based alloys possess promising engineering properties for lightweight high-temperature applications. Due to the complexity of their manufacturing, however, they are still not fully commercialised. Recently, a manufacturing route has been introduced for $\beta$-stabilised $\gamma$-TiAl based alloys that is effectively abridged compared to the conventional ingot metallurgy route. The present work explores the impact of each proposed processing stage on a $\beta$-solidifying, multi-phase Ti-43.5Al-4Nb-1Mo-0.1B (in at.-{\%}) alloy. Texture measurements using synchrotron radiation were conducted and combined with microstructural analyses. The experiments allowed to fundamentally correlate the processing, which included heat treatment steps for balanced mechanical properties, with the evolution of both microstructure and texture. Thereby, the influences of deformation, recovery and recrystallisation, and phase transformations could be identified. The results reveal several options to optimise the material properties within the cost-effective manufacturing route. One option discussed in depth is the layout of the temperature profile in connection with the exploitation of the prevailing phase transformations. The presented findings are expected to improve the future design of $\gamma$-TiAl based sheet manufacturing routes.},

The orientation factors of various slip systems are calculated according to Schmid law. The slip systems activated in a grain of tricrystal nickel film basically conform to Schmid law which is completely suitable for a single crystal. The activated slip systems play an important role in plastic deformation of nanoscale tricrystal nickel film subjected to uniaxial tensile loading. The slip directions exhibit great difference among the activated slip systems such that the void is caused to be subjected to various stress conditions, which further leads to the difference in void growth among the tricrystal nickel films with different orientation distributions. It can be concluded that the grain orientation distribution has a significant influence on void growth at the triple junction of grain boundaries.},

The change in microhardness was found to occur in two stages regardless of the amount of reduction; the first stage associated with the decrease in dislocation density and the second stage related with the annealing-out of deformation twins introduced in TiAl lamallae during rolling. However, the recrystallization mode was found to vary depending on the amount of reduction in thickness. In specimens rolled to less than 20{\%} reduction in thickness, the full recovery in hardness occurs preserving the lamellar structure. In contrast, in specimens rolled to more than 40{\%}, a structure composed of equiaxed grains of TiAl is obtained after recrystallization.

abstract = {Abstract We present dislocation simulations involving the collective behavior of partials and extended full dislocations in nanocrystalline materials. While atomistic simulations have shown the importance of including partial dislocations in high strain rate simulations, the behavior of partial dislocations in complex geometries with lower strain rates has not been explored. To account for the dissociation of dislocations into partials we include the full representation of the gamma surface for two materials: Ni and Al. During loading, dislocation loops are emitted from grain boundaries and expand into the grain interiors to carry the strain. In agreement with high strain rate simulations we find that Al has a higher density of extended full dislocations with smaller stacking fault widths than Ni. We also observe that configurations with smaller average grain size have a higher density of partial dislocations, but contrary to simplified analytical models we do not find a critical grain size below which there is only partial dislocation-mediated deformation. Our results show that the density of partial dislocations is stable in agreement with in situ X-ray experiments that show no increase of the stacking fault density in deformed nanocrystalline Ni (Budrovic et al., 2004). Furthermore, the ratio between partial and extended full dislocation contribution to strain varies with the amount of deformation. The contribution of extended full dislocations to strain grows beyond the contribution of partial dislocations as the deformation proceeds, suggesting that there is no well-defined transition from full dislocation- to partial dislocation-mediated plasticity based uniquely on the grain size.},

abstract = {With properties lying between those of metals and ceramics, intermetallic compounds are particularly attractive for high temperature structural applications. Considerable progress has been made in improving the ductility of these rather brittle materials, especially with the titanium aluminides Ti3Al (alpha-2) and TiAl (gamma). But monolithic intermetallic compounds are unlikely to have the right combination of ambient temperature ductility and high temperature strength for the most demanding aeroengine applications. Further progress depends on the development of engineered composite materials, which exploit the combined potential of ceramics, intermetallics and metals to give a desirable balance of properties. This paper reviews developments in intermetallic matrix composites (IMCs), concentrating on the last four years and drawing examples from the three most widely researched matrix systems: titanium aluminides, nickel aluminides and molybdenum disilicide.},

abstract = {In the absence of pre-existing failure-critical defects, the fracture or tearing process in deformable metals loaded in tension begins with the nucleation of internal cavities or voids in regions of elevated triaxial stress. While ductile rupture processes initiate at inclusions or precipitates in many alloys, nucleation in pure metals is often assumed to be associated with grain boundaries or triple junctions. This study presents ex situ observations of incipient, subsurface void nucleation in pure tantalum during interrupted uniaxial tensile tests using electron channeling contrast (ECC) imaging, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Instead of forming at grain boundaries, voids initiated at and grew along dislocation cell and cell block boundaries created by plastic deformation. Most of the voids were associated with extended, lamellar deformation-induced boundaries that run along the traces of the {\{}110{\}} or {\{}112{\}} planes, though a few voids initiated at low-angle dislocation subgrain boundaries. In general, a high density of deformation-induced boundaries was observed near the voids. TEM and TKD demonstrate that voids initiate at and grow along cell block boundaries. Two mechanisms for void nucleation in pure metals, vacancy condensation and stored energy dissipation, are discussed in light of these results. The observations of the present investigation suggest that voids in pure materials nucleate by vacancy condensation and subsequently grow by consuming dislocations.},

One void and two void specimens with identical initial void volume fractions were utilized to study the mechanism of void growth and coalescence. In order to study the influences of material length scale on void evolution in single crystals four specimen sizes with the same initial volume fraction of voids were considered. Investigations of the effects of temperature and strain rate were also performed. Uniaxial stress-strain curves were monitored during increasing employed strain. The simulation results show that the specimen size, loading strain rate and temperature had apparent influences on the twin or dislocation pattern, void evolution shape and uniaxial stress-strain responses, but negligible effects on the initial slopes of the uniaxial stress-strain curves. Furthermore, the nucleation stress of twin bands in orientation A - x[0 0 0 1]-y[1 over(2, ̄) 1 0]-z[1 0 over(1, ̄) 0] was much higher than that of plastic deformation in orientation B - x[1 over(2, ̄) 1 0]-y[1 0 over(1, ̄) 0]-z[0 0 0 1].},

abstract = {Nano- and submicron-grained intermetallic compounds consisting of $\gamma$-TiAl and $\xi$-Ti5(Si,Al)3were produced by high energy milling and hot isostatic pressing. Owing to the pure and controlled processing conditions, the mechanical properties may be indubitably related to the microstructure. Both yield strength and hardness show a Hall-Petch-type dependence on grain size, resulting in extremely high flow and fracture stresses under compression of up to 3 GPa. With a reduction of grain size, the coefficient of strain hardening as well as the compressive fracture strain decrease and drop to zero for alloys with grain sizes of about 150 nm. Deformation at room temperature is accomplished by dislocation glide and mechanical twinning, with twinning attaining more and more importance as the grain size is further reduced. Diffusion-controlled deformation mechanisms can be ruled out even for intermetallics with crystallite sizes as small as 50 nm. A room temperature ductilization of intermetallic compounds by switching to a nanocrystalline microstructure seems to be rather unlikely.},

The grain size dependence of yield stress and the atomic fraction of dislocations are quantified and the size dependence tensile nanomechanics are also revealed. Deformation twinning and grain boundary migration are observed as main mechanisms of tensile deformation in the nanocrystalline Al. In particular, the complete Hall-Petch relationship for the nanocrystalline Al bulk is determined for the first time in this study, from which three distinct regions are identified including the normal, inverse, and extended regions in the Hall-Petch relationship. We expect these findings will provide useful insights in the nanomechanics of nanocrystalline Al. The quantitation analyses on dislocations and mechanical properties may facilitate the design and development of high strength nanocrystalline Al and Al based alloys as well as future testing procedures for promising structural and transportation applications.},

The voids appear to be formed by the phase change from the Ni2Al3to $\beta$-NiAl during oxidation.

abstract = {The creep deformation behaviour and creep microstructures of a dual phase TiAl/Ti3Al alloy Ti48Al2Cr (at.{\%}) with a fully transformed lamellar structure have been investigated at 800°C in tension creep. The creep curves show no steady state creep rate, rather a minimum creep rate was obtained followed by a steep increase in the creep rate. The application of a power-law creep equation of the type dot $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}} = A$\sigma$nleads to a stress exponent n = 7.6. The deformation microstructures show no deformation twins and essentially consist of 1 2{\textless}110] dislocations; recovered structures were observed in the fine $\gamma$-grains at colony boundaries whereas long and curved 1 2{\textless}110] segments were found in the $\gamma$-lamellae. These microstructural observations suggest a dislocation controlled creep; it ensues that the stress exponent obtained using power-law creep does not reflect the operating creep mechanism. This is attributed to early nucleation and growth of voids and cavities at colony boundaries which do not allow steady-state creep to be established, an underlying condition for the applicability of the power-law equation above. The nucleation and growth of void and cavities are thought to arise as a result of stress buildup at colony boundaries which in turn results from the dependence of deformation behaviour on the orientation of the lamellar colonies with respect to the tensile axis. The loss of creep strength is found to be primarily due to growth and coalescence of these voids and cavities. {\textcopyright} 1994.},
