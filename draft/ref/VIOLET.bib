abstract = {In the absence of pre-existing failure-critical defects, the fracture or tearing process in deformable metals loaded in tension begins with the nucleation of internal cavities or voids in regions of elevated triaxial stress. While ductile rupture processes initiate at inclusions or precipitates in many alloys, nucleation in pure metals is often assumed to be associated with grain boundaries or triple junctions. This study presents ex situ observations of incipient, subsurface void nucleation in pure tantalum during interrupted uniaxial tensile tests using electron channeling contrast (ECC) imaging, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Instead of forming at grain boundaries, voids initiated at and grew along dislocation cell and cell block boundaries created by plastic deformation. Most of the voids were associated with extended, lamellar deformation-induced boundaries that run along the traces of the {\{}110{\}} or {\{}112{\}} planes, though a few voids initiated at low-angle dislocation subgrain boundaries. In general, a high density of deformation-induced boundaries was observed near the voids. TEM and TKD demonstrate that voids initiate at and grow along cell block boundaries. Two mechanisms for void nucleation in pure metals, vacancy condensation and stored energy dissipation, are discussed in light of these results. The observations of the present investigation suggest that voids in pure materials nucleate by vacancy condensation and subsequently grow by consuming dislocations.},

Depending on the overall alloy composition and on the solubility of the present phases for niobium, new phases may be introduced in the alloys' microstructure upon niobium addition.

We identify the orthorhombic O-phase within $\alpha$2 laths of lamellar ($\alpha$2 + $\gamma$) colonies by single crystal electron diffraction and high-resolution imaging. Domains of O-phase variants and $\alpha$2 phase form columnar crystallites in $\alpha$2 (0001) planes having low indexed $\alpha$2 {\{}11-20{\}} and {\{}1-100{\}} interface planes. The nm-sized domains are rotated with respect to each other resulting in elastic strains across the domain boundaries. No elemental segregation of Nb was detected in $\alpha$2/O-phase lamellae.},

abstract = {Brittle fracture in carbon steel has a strong impact on the safety of the structures. Especially, the arresting technology of the running crack is the measure of last resort for ensuring structural integrity. Due to such high importance, many experimental and theoretical studies of brittle crack propagation have been conducted from both mechanical and microstructural viewpoints. It is thought that the elementary step of the brittle fracture of polycrystalline steel is the cleavage in each crystal grain and their connection process. However, the detailed mechanisms of brittle fracture have not been fully understood; for example, it is still unclear why the propagation rate under a large driving force is not increased up to the Rayleigh wave speed. Several difficulties hinder the achievement of a detailed understanding so far: 1) crack propagation is quite rapid, 2) the crystal grain is usually too small (10–100 $\mu$m) to collect sufficient information, 3) the microstructure is very complicated in most case, i.e., containing different phases, microstructures, precipitates and inclusions. In this study, to eliminate such difficulties, 3{\%} silicon steel in which microstructure is the ferrite single phase and the grain size is increased to 4–5 mm is used. This steel can be fractured in a brittle manner, even under ambient temperature. For this steel, by using a high speed camera and strain gauge data with a high sampling rate, the elementary process of brittle crack propagation is elucidated. As a result, it is revealed that the brittle crack propagation rate even in a single-crystal grain is much slower than the Rayleigh wave speed. This seems to be due to the presence of twin deformations and twin boundary cracks in crystal grain as observed on the fracture surface. Using the analysis of electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) data, the mechanism of twin deformation and twin boundary crack is revealed. Additionally, it is shown that the brittle crack propagation rate where the path includes crystal grain boundaries is much slower. This delay seems to be related to the misorientation angle at the GB. By applying our simplified model, the delay effect at the grain boundary can be successfully explained.},

abstract = {This work carries out comprehensive classical molecular dynamics simulations of uniaxial tensile deformation for nanocrystalline Al samples with a broad range of different mean grain sizes. The largest nanocrystalline Al sample has a mean grain size of about 30 nm and contains over 100 millions atoms in the modeling system. The grain size dependence of yield stress and the atomic fraction of dislocations are quantified and the size dependence tensile nanomechanics are also revealed. Deformation twinning and grain boundary migration are observed as main mechanisms of tensile deformation in the nanocrystalline Al. In particular, the complete Hall-Petch relationship for the nanocrystalline Al bulk is determined for the first time in this study, from which three distinct regions are identified including the normal, inverse, and extended regions in the Hall-Petch relationship. We expect these findings will provide useful insights in the nanomechanics of nanocrystalline Al. The quantitation analyses on dislocations and mechanical properties may facilitate the design and development of high strength nanocrystalline Al and Al based alloys as well as future testing procedures for promising structural and transportation applications.},

We suggest a theoretical framework to predict the deformation mode for a given uniaxial loading condition based on the generalized stacking fault energy and Schmid factor. The theory explains four deformation mechanisms, namely, ordinary slip, super slip, twinning, and mixed slip/fracture, observed from tensile and compressive tests along 10 different orientations using molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, the deformation modes of the nanowire are different from existing bulk experiments for a few exceptions; these differences can be explained by the size dependent deformation mechanism. The present study provides a systematic method to predict the deformation mode of $\gamma$-TiAl crystal that is readily applicable to other intermetallic crystals with complex slip systems.},

abstract = {The evolution, growth and coalescence, of nanovoids play a significant role in the plasticity of nanocrystalline metallic materials. Previous atomistic studies of void growth in face centered copper, and other metallic materials, have considered voids in single crystals, and those located at grain boundaries in polycrystals. The evolution of a spherical nanovoid in copper polycrystals under uniaxial tension is the focus of this atomistic investigation. In this paper, a critical stress based criterion is proposed for emission of dislocations from spherical void surfaces. The preference of dislocation source, GBs or spherical void surfaces, is determined by the relative magnitude of the critical stresses to emit dislocations from GBs or spherical void surfaces. The criterion reveals that there exists a grain size dependent critical void diameter at which the dislocation emission transits from GBs to spherical void surfaces as the spherical void grows. Simulation results show that, in intragranular voided models, the critical void diameter is 13 nm for simulation models with a 16.32 nm grain size and is 5.5 nm for simulation models with a 6.92 nm grain size. The critical void diameters revealed by simulations are in agreement with that obtained by the criterion. In addition, the simulation results indicate that the Gurson's model may be extended to predict the global yield conditions for simulation models with intragranular spherical voids. In the simulation models with intergranular voids, the spherical void continuously grows due to the initial dislocation emission from the intersections of GBs and spherical void surfaces.},

The nucleation, the emission and the transmission of Shockley partial dislocations play a predominant role in the growth of void at the triple junction of grain boundaries. The orientation factors of various slip systems are calculated according to Schmid law. The slip systems activated in a grain of tricrystal nickel film basically conform to Schmid law which is completely suitable for a single crystal. The activated slip systems play an important role in plastic deformation of nanoscale tricrystal nickel film subjected to uniaxial tensile loading. The slip directions exhibit great difference among the activated slip systems such that the void is caused to be subjected to various stress conditions, which further leads to the difference in void growth among the tricrystal nickel films with different orientation distributions. It can be concluded that the grain orientation distribution has a significant influence on void growth at the triple junction of grain boundaries.},

Investigations of the effects of temperature and strain rate were also performed. Uniaxial stress-strain curves were monitored during increasing employed strain. The simulation results show that the specimen size, loading strain rate and temperature had apparent influences on the twin or dislocation pattern, void evolution shape and uniaxial stress-strain responses, but negligible effects on the initial slopes of the uniaxial stress-strain curves.

However, the occurrence of this longitudinal twinning mode was less common by at least a factor of ten in tests at room temperature. Furthermore, the debonding of colony boundaries caused by the shear strain of longitudinal twinning is exacerbated when the same $\gamma$-TiAl variant favourably oriented for twinning occurs repeatedly in the lamellar structure. This effect was caused by the preferential nucleation of certain $\gamma$-TiAl variants in the presence of TiB2boride reinforcement. It is shown that the boride additions increase the probability of double, triple or even higher order multiply stacked $\gamma$-variants. This increases the resulting shear strain that must be accommodated and hence the probability of crack nucleation.},

During the compression, the nano-void crystal undergoes elastic then plastic deformation process. In the elastic period, the nano-void shrinks linearly along compression direction while it expands linearly along the directions perpendicular to the compression direction. Finally, the nano-void collapses from all directions at the beginning of the plastic process. The formation and extension of dislocations and the shrinking mechanism of void were analyzed in detail. The dependence of the void shrinking on the specimen size, strain rate, and void volume fraction were also investigated. It is found that the stacking faults' slipping in the crystal during plastic period is the main deformation mechanism of the void shrinkage: dislocation structures initially start to nucleate around the equator area of the void, then partial dislocations and planar faults constantly propagate, finally the stacking faults and partial dislocations swap through the entire system and the void shrinks.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently - those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers - the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Museums in Taiwan have developed various digital archives, but few people have visited these digital archives. Therefore, this study designed a digital archaeology game for high school students to play. Based on the concept of “learning for playing” (i.e., players who want to win will study more), the digital archaeology game contest aims at attracting students to visit the natural science digital museum. In the game, researchers (players) reorient the artifacts, structures and architectures through excavation and assemblages to understand the world of natural science based on the saliency-based model. To examine whether this game prompts learners to visit the natural science digital museum to acquire knowledge, 80 students from three high schools were recruited and grouped into 40 pairs to compete against each other. After the contest, questionnaires were collected and analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the research participants' gameplay self-efficacy affected their perceived hedonic values and was mediated by the perceived ease of playing the game increased their intention to visit the digital archives of the natural science museum. The implications of this study could be used for promotion of digital archives or other digital museums. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Aging at intermediate temperatures produces precipitate particles predominantly along $\alpha$2/$\gamma$ lamellar interfaces or within $\alpha$2lamellae. Most of the precipitates are $\beta$-particles with fewer silicides. Aging at intermediate temperatures leads to increased tensile strength as a result of precipitation of $\beta$ and silicide particles. In addition, aging yields an increased primary creep resistance but a shortened creep life for the FL structure. The shortened creep life of the aged FL structures could be a result of early decomposition of $\alpha$2lamellae during creep. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to study the shrinkage of spherical nano-void under uniaxial compression load in $\gamma$-TiAl single crystal. During the compression, the nano-void crystal undergoes elastic then plastic deformation process. In the elastic period, the nano-void shrinks linearly along compression direction while it expands linearly along the directions perpendicular to the compression direction. Finally, the nano-void collapses from all directions at the beginning of the plastic process. The formation and extension of dislocations and the shrinking mechanism of void were analyzed in detail. The dependence of the void shrinking on the specimen size, strain rate, and void volume fraction were also investigated. It is found that the stacking faults' slipping in the crystal during plastic period is the main deformation mechanism of the void shrinkage: dislocation structures initially start to nucleate around the equator area of the void, then partial dislocations and planar faults constantly propagate, finally the stacking faults and partial dislocations swap through the entire system and the void shrinks.},

In situ tensile and fracture toughness tests were performed in vacuum using a high-temperature loading stage in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), while conventional tensile tests were performed in air. The results revealed strong influences of microstructure on the crack-tip deformation, quasi-static crack growth, and the fracture initiation behaviors in the alloy. Intergranular fracture and cleavage were the dominant fracture mechanisms in the duplex microstructure material, whose fracture remained brittle at temperatures up to 600 °C. In contrast, the nearly fully lamellar microstructure resulted in a relatively high crack growth resistance in the 25 °C to 800 °C range, with interface delamination, translamellar fracture, and decohesion of colony boundaries being the main fracture processes. The higher fracture resistance exhibited by the lamellar microstructure can be attributed, at least partly, to toughening by shear ligaments formed as the result of mismatched crack planes in the process zone. {\textcopyright} 1992 The Minerals, Metals  {\&}  Materials Society and ASM International.},

Designing materials for radiation environments necessitates a fundamental understanding of how radiation-induced defects alter mechanical properties. Ion beams create radiation damage efficiently without material activation, but their limited penetration depth requires small-scale testing. However, strength measurements of nanoscale irradiated specimens have not been previously performed. Here we show that yield strengths approaching macroscopic values are measured from irradiated {\~{}}400 nm-diameter copper specimens. Quantitative in situ nanocompression testing in a transmission electron microscope reveals that the strength of larger samples is controlled by dislocation-irradiation defect interactions, yielding size-independent strengths. Below {\~{}}400 nm, size-dependent strength results from dislocation source limitation. This transition length-scale should be universal, but depends on material and irradiation conditions. We conclude that for irradiated copper, and presumably related materials, nanoscale in situ testing can determine bulk-like yield strengths and simultaneously identify deformation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation of uniaxial tension along [001] has been performed to study the influence of various surface defects on the initiation of plastic deformation and fracture of $\gamma$-TiAl single crystals. The results indicate that brittle fracture occurs in perfect bulk; surfaces and edges will be detrimental to the strength of materials and provide dislocation nucleation site. The defects on surfaces and edges cause further weakening with various effects depending on defect type, size, position and orientation, while the edge dimples are the most influential. For $\gamma$-TiAl rods with surface dimples, dislocations nucleate from an edge of the rod when dimples are small, dimple dislocation nucleation occurs only when the dimples are larger than a strain rate dependent critical size. The dislocations nucleated upon [001] tension are super dislocations with Burger vectors {\textless}011] or 1/2 {\textless} 112] containing four 1/6 {\textless} 112 {\textgreater} partials. The effects of surface scratches are orientation and shape sensitive. Scratches parallel to the loading direction have little influence, while sharp ones perpendicular to the loading direction may cause crack and thus should be avoided. This simulation also shows that, any type of surface defect would lower strength, and cause crack in some cases. But some may facilitate dislocation nucleation and improve ductility of TiAl if well controlled.},

abstract = {In this work, the evolution of the dislocations microstructure in single crystal two-phase superalloy microcrystals under monotonic loading has been studied using the three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) method. The DDD framework has been extended to properly handle the collective behavior of dislocations and their interactions with large collections of arbitrary shaped precipitates. Few constraints are imposed on the initial distribution of the dislocations or the precipitates, and the extended DDD framework can support experimentally-obtained precipitate geometries. Full tracking of the creation and destruction of anti-phase boundaries (APB) is accounted for. The effects of the precipitate volume fraction, APB energy, precipitate size, and crystal size on the deformation of superalloy microcrystals have been quantified. Correlations between the precipitate microstructure and the dominant deformation features, such as dislocation looping versus precipitate shearing, are also discussed. It is shown that the mechanical strength is independent of the crystal size, increases linearly with increasing the volume fraction, follows a near square-root relationship with the APB energy and an inverse square-root relationship with the precipitate size. Finally, the flow strength in simulations having initial dislocation pair sources show a flow strength that is about one half of that predicted from simulations starting with single dislocation sources. The method developed can be used, with minimal extensions, to simulate dislocation microstructure evolution in general multiphase materials.},

Owing to the pure and controlled processing conditions, the mechanical properties may be indubitably related to the microstructure. Both yield strength and hardness show a Hall-Petch-type dependence on grain size, resulting in extremely high flow and fracture stresses under compression of up to 3 GPa. With a reduction of grain size, the coefficient of strain hardening as well as the compressive fracture strain decrease and drop to zero for alloys with grain sizes of about 150 nm. Deformation at room temperature is accomplished by dislocation glide and mechanical twinning, with twinning attaining more and more importance as the grain size is further reduced. Diffusion-controlled deformation mechanisms can be ruled out even for intermetallics with crystallite sizes as small as 50 nm. A room temperature ductilization of intermetallic compounds by switching to a nanocrystalline microstructure seems to be rather unlikely.},

abstract = {Dislocation interactions with distributed condensed vacancy clusters in fcc metals were simulated via a concurrent atomistic-continuum method. Due to void strengthening, the dislocation lines are found to bow as a result of pinning on the original glide plane and undergo depinning through drawing out screw dipoles and forming prismatic loops on the secondary slip plane. We discovered an inertia-induced transition between Hirsch looping and void shearing mechanisms as the void spacing ranges from the scale of nm to hundreds of nm. Contrary to prior understanding, simulations suggest that large voids (∼5 nm in diameter) can behave as weak barriers to dislocation motions under high strain-rate dynamic conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multiscale modeling framework based on microscale crystal plasticity theory and macroscale element-free methodology for computational simulation of polycrystalline metals. The element-free method employs an improved moving least squares (IMLS) shape function in the Ritz procedure for computational simulation. In the multiscale modeling scheme, the macroscale strain increments of polycrystalline metals are solved by the element-free method and transferred into the mesoscale grains through a scale transition law, and further transferred into the microscale slip systems through the Schmid's law. The shear strain increments of all grains are then summed up and averaged to calculate the macroscale plastic strain increment. Functions of the temperature-related hardening parameters of the slip systems are determined by calibrating with experimental data. Then, tensile tests are performed on polycrystalline sheets to study their deformation behavior at elevated temperatures. The plasticity of polycrystalline sheets is found to be significantly affected by the grain size. The concentration of shear stress and additional hardening are occurred at the grain boundaries of soft and hard grains. Moreover, it is revealed that the yield strength of the polycrystalline sheets is greatly reduced as the hardening parameters and thermal softening factor decrease at elevated temperatures.},

abstract = {This paper describes a numerical, hierarchical multiscale modeling methodology involving two distinct bridges over three different length scales that predicts the work hardening of face centered cubic crystals in the absence of physical experiments. This methodology builds a clear bridging approach connecting nano-, micro- and meso-scales. In this methodology, molecular dynamics simulations (nanoscale) are performed to generate mobilities for dislocations. A discrete dislocations numerical tool (microscale) then uses the mobility data obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations to determine the work hardening. The second bridge occurs as the material parameters in a slip system hardening law employed in crystal plasticity models (mesoscale) are determined by the dislocation dynamics simulation results. The material parameters are computed using a correlation procedure based on both the functional form of the hardening law and the internal elastic stress/plastic shear strain fields computed from discrete dislocations. This multiscale bridging methodology was validated by using a crystal plasticity model to predict the mechanical response of an aluminum single crystal deformed under uniaxial compressive loading along the [4 2 1] direction. The computed strain-stress response agrees well with the experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Equations relating tensile void growth rates to microstructure for both equiaxed,E, and Widmanst{\"{a}}tten plus grain boundary$\alpha$, W + ITG. B.,in aged $\beta$ morphologies have been derived. A mechanism for void formation at $\alpha$-$\beta$ interfaces is presented which accounts for the observed fact that voids do not form at Widmanst{\"{a}}tten $\alpha$ platelets. Tensile fracture is shown to be intergranular in nature and occurs when a critical crack length-stress relationship is satisfied. The amount of ductility achievable in a specimen depends upon the rate of void growth. If the rate is large, the void reaches a critical size for fracture at a lower applied stress and strain and hence the ductility is less.},

abstract = {By using molecular dynamics and cluster dynamics simulations, we probed the role of hydrogen-vacancy complexes on nucleation and growth of proto nano-voids upon dislocation plasticity in $\alpha$-Fe. Our atomistic simulations reveal that, unlike a lattice vacancy, a hydrogen-vacancy complex is not absorbed by dislocations sweeping through the lattice. Additionally, this complex has lower lattice diffusivity; therefore, it has a lower probability of encountering and being absorbed by various lattice sinks. Hence, it can exist metastably for a rather long time. Our large-scale molecular dynamics simulations show that when metals undergo plastic deformation in the presence of hydrogen at low homologous temperatures, the mechanically driven out-of-equilibrium dislocation processes can produce extremely high concentrations of hydrogen-vacancy complex (10-5∼ 10-3). Under such high concentrations, these complexes prefer to grow by absorbing additional vacancies and act as the embryos for the formation of proto nano-voids. The current work provides one possible route for the experimentally observed nano-void formation in hydrogen embrittlement of steels and bridges atomic-scale events and damage with macroscopic failure.},

They only emit light at the free exciton (1.491 eV) and the donor bound exciton transition (1.4855 eV). The ZB NWs exhibit a photoluminescence spectrum being unaffected by the twinning planes.

@article{Stein1960,
abstract = {A method has been developed whereby the velocity of motion of fresh dislocations introduced into a crystal by scratching the surface may be measured as a function of stress. The velocities of unpinned edge dislocations in 3¼{\%} silicon‐iron have been measured as a function of stress over a range of five orders of magnitude in velocity from 10−7 cm/sec to 10−2 cm/sec. The velocity has been found to be very sensitive to the applied stress in this velocity range. Measurements of velocity as a function of stress have been made for four temperatures in the range 78°K to 373°K. It has been found that over this range of temperature the yield stress changes with temperature in the same way as the stress to produce a constant velocity of dislocationmotion. From the result it is concluded that the rise in yield stress at low temperatures exhibited by this siliconiron is due primarily to an increase in the lattice resistance to dislocationmotion and not to an increase in the Cottrell locking force. Preliminary experiments on pinned dislocations suggest that there may also be an effect of temperature on the strength of pinning by impurities which would be superimposed on the increase in lattice resistance with decreasing temperature.},

@article{Rao1994,
abstract = {In lamellar TiAl the flat-plate geometry of the grains, the barriers to deformation across the grain boundaries and the coherency stresses all contribute to a marked anisotropy in the yield and fracture stresses of the material . Both yield and fracture occur at low stresses when the deformation is within the lamellae (soft mode) and they occur at high stresses when the deformation crosses the lamellae (hard mode). The anisotropy is enhanced by a new effect which can soften the soft mode and harden the hard mode: the geometry of the lamellar boundary produces degeneracies in the planar fault energies at the interfaces which enhance the mobilities of dislocations on these interfaces. These degeneracies modify the core structure of dislocations on or near the interfaces, consequently soft mode dislocations can dissociate widely and move more easily when their glide plane is contained in the interface. Hard mode dislocations can substantially reduce their core energies when intersecting a $\gamma$/$\gamma$ interface, and subsequently become immobilized, by cross slipping on to the interface plane. This paper presents a discussion of the geometry and relative energies of the $\gamma$/$\gamma$ interfaces using elements of Bollman O-lattice theory. In order to investigate the influence of the interfaces on dislocation core structure we have fit an empirical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential to the structural and elastic properties of bulk L10 TiAl. The mobility and core structure of the twinning dislocation at the 180° interface and the perfect, 1/ 2〈110] screw dislocation at the 60° and 120° interfaces were calculated using molecular statics within the EAM. We have also studied the influence of one and two atomic step ledges on dislocation mobility in the 12° interface. We find in general that dislocations are more glissile on the $\gamma$/$\gamma$ interfaces, as compared to bulk TiAl and that ledges are weak barriers to dislocation glide. The interfaces themselves are strong barriers to 1/2〈110] screw dislocations gliding on conjugate (111) planes are trapped at these interfaces, as a result of lower core energies for screw dislocations lying in the interface.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze nanovoid growth in single crystalline vanadium under tension. Radial distribution function at the first nearest neighbor distance was calculated to find out the critical strain rate below which the deformation of specimen was static. Then a tensile stress was exerted on both void contained box and intact box under two constraint conditions. Homogenous dislocations were nucleated in intact box at yield point; while for void contained box with void radius twice the lattice constant, 〈1 1 1〉{\{}1 1 0{\}} shear loops were punched out from void surface. The formation of shear loops was the result of the splitting of purely screw cores on three non-planar planes, as well as their transformations to more stable two-fold non-planar dislocations under tension. The asymmetry of loops was influenced by both strain rate and triaxiality of system. It is also found that, in lower rate cases the yield point and peak stress point coincided; however, the two points separated at higher rate due to the inadequate void growth rate. Mean square displacement of void surface atoms were given out to geometrically depict the void evolution. Moreover, simulations with different initial porosity and box size were performed respectively. It is shown that when void reduced to contain only one vacancy, dislocations can be nucleated independently of the void; when porosity was large enough, the interactions between void and its periodic images were noticeable. Also, when both the void and box were large, triangular prismatic loops on {\{}1 1 0{\}} planes were observed at void surface, which may be contributed to a combined effect of the intersection of shear loops and the ledges along the void surface. Finally, the results of our MD simulations agreed well with that from Lubarda equation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Long-range internal back stresses developed during room temperature tensile deformation of titanium aluminide alloys have been determined. Dip tests were implemented during the strain-controlled tensile deformation and the resulting sample deformation was monitored in the relaxation regime of the machine. The internal stress was determined as the critical stress at which the inelastic sample relaxation is reversed, i.e. going from the tensile direction to the compression direction. The investigation involves a wide range of alloy compositions with a corresponding variation in the strength properties. For the alloys investigated, the internal stress is about 80{\%} of the yield stress. The mechanical tests were coupled with electron microscopy examination of the defect structure in order to assess the strain accommodation occurring during deformation. Possible sources for the built up internal stresses are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The recovery and recrystallization behavior of cold-rolled polysynthetically twinned (PST) crystals of TiAl with a nearly stoichiometric composition was investigated as a function of reduction in thickness and subsequent annealing time at 900 and 1000°C. The change in microhardness was found to occur in two stages regardless of the amount of reduction; the first stage associated with the decrease in dislocation density and the second stage related with the annealing-out of deformation twins introduced in TiAl lamallae during rolling. However, the recrystallization mode was found to vary depending on the amount of reduction in thickness. In specimens rolled to less than 20{\%} reduction in thickness, the full recovery in hardness occurs preserving the lamellar structure. In contrast, in specimens rolled to more than 40{\%}, a structure composed of equiaxed grains of TiAl is obtained after recrystallization. A mechanism is proposed to interpret the unusual recrystallization behavior of PST crystals of TiAl cold-rolled to less than 20{\%}. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

After irradiations, microchemical changes at the void surfaces and matrices were analyzed by EDS. At temperatures below 573 K, where the effect of long range migration of vacancies is negligibly small, the interstitial loop density in FeCrNiP alloys was considerably higher than that in pure FeCrNi ternaries. This indicates that the addition of phosphorus significantly influences the nucleation of interstitial loops at these temperatures. From the temperature dependence of the loop density, an interstitial-phosphorus binding energy of 0.5 eV was derived. At temperatures above 573 K void swelling or vacancy loop formation is prominent and shifted upward by 100 K. Moreover, solute (Ni) segregation to the void surface and matrix were suppressed by phosphorus addition. Such phenomena are thought to be the result of vacancy-phosphorus interaction. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The creep deformation behaviour and creep microstructures of a dual phase TiAl/Ti3Al alloy Ti48Al2Cr (at.{\%}) with a fully transformed lamellar structure have been investigated at 800°C in tension creep. The creep curves show no steady state creep rate, rather a minimum creep rate was obtained followed by a steep increase in the creep rate. The application of a power-law creep equation of the type dot $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}} = A$\sigma$nleads to a stress exponent n = 7.6. The deformation microstructures show no deformation twins and essentially consist of 1 2{\textless}110] dislocations; recovered structures were observed in the fine $\gamma$-grains at colony boundaries whereas long and curved 1 2{\textless}110] segments were found in the $\gamma$-lamellae. These microstructural observations suggest a dislocation controlled creep; it ensues that the stress exponent obtained using power-law creep does not reflect the operating creep mechanism. This is attributed to early nucleation and growth of voids and cavities at colony boundaries which do not allow steady-state creep to be established, an underlying condition for the applicability of the power-law equation above. The nucleation and growth of void and cavities are thought to arise as a result of stress buildup at colony boundaries which in turn results from the dependence of deformation behaviour on the orientation of the lamellar colonies with respect to the tensile axis. The loss of creep strength is found to be primarily due to growth and coalescence of these voids and cavities. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The tensile behavior of monocrystalline nickel with nano-void was studied via molecular dynamics simulation (MD) considering different lattice orientations. A series of simulations were performed to analyze the effect of system size, void volume fraction and lattice orientation on mechanical properties and microstructure evolution. The influence of size of sample on the incipient yield stress is discussed. The results show that void volume fractions have significant effects on Young's modulus, incipient yield stress and incipient yield strain. Dislocation structure begins to nucleate in the stress concentration area. The critical stress of [1 0 0], [1 1 0] and [1 1 1] orientation is 6.97 GPa, 6.77 GPa and 7.31 GPa, respectively. The results of dislocation propagation and stress-strain responses reveal the elastic-plastic properties of different orientations. The fracture strain is the elongation of the specimen. The elongation of the sample along [1 1 1] orientation is greatest, which illustrate that the sample has good ductility performance along [1 1 1] orientation in the same initial damage. The reaction between the dislocations and the boundary leads to the rearrangement of the boundary atoms, which proves that the dislocation can not be stopped inside the crystal, or closed or terminated at the crystal surface or grain boundary. The difference of the rearrangement of the boundary atoms is due to the difference of the sliding systems of different orientations.},

Defects consisting of a random distribution of vacancies were introduced in the precracked matrix. The results reveal a significant change in the fracture behavior of Al with defects. The interactions between the crack tip and vacancies were found to modify the stress concentrations at the crack tip. Increase in vacancy content lead to increased crack tip blunting and reduced crack propagation speeds as compared to the vacancy-free material, thereby toughening the material to fracture. The significance of such studies towards gaining deeper insights into the fracture behavior at higher scales is highlighted.},

abstract = {Successful scientific applications of large-scale molecular dynamics often rely on automated methods for identifying the local crystalline structure of condensed phases. Many existing methods for structural identification, such as Common Neighbour Analysis, rely on interatomic distances (or thresholds thereof) to classify atomic structure. As a consequence they are sensitive to strain and thermal displacements, and preprocessing such as quenching or temporal averaging of the atomic positions is necessary to provide reliable identifications. We propose a new method, Polyhedral Template Matching (PTM), which classifies structures according to the topology of the local atomic environment, without any ambiguity in the classification, and with greater reliability than e.g. Common Neighbour Analysis in the presence of thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that the method can reliably be used to identify structures even in simulations near the melting point, and that it can identify the most common ordered alloy structures as well. In addition, the method makes it easy to identify the local lattice orientation in polycrystalline samples, and to calculate the local strain tensor.

MD simulation can then determine the interfacial traction-separation relationship between Ti6Al4V and TiC. The interatomic potential between the atoms in Ti6Al4V/TiC composite is defined by the second-nearest neighborhood modified embedded atom method (2NN MEAM) and the Morse potential. For Vanadium-Carbon (V-C) interatomic potential, the 2NN MEAM parameters are developed and validated based on previous first principle calculations conducted on VC structure. MD simulation results show asymmetrical crack propagation along the interface between Ti6Al4V/TiC and the crack propagates in Ti6Al4V than along the interface. The obtained traction-separation relationship is used to parametrize the cohesive zone model (CZM) for modeling the interface in finite element analysis. Validation of the parameterized relationship is done by finite element simulation of the compression test of Ti6Al4V/TiC at different volume fractions of TiC. A good agreement is shown between the stress-strain results obtained from simulation and the experimental data under the same conditions.},

The coating has a duplex layer structure, an outer Ni2Al3layer and an inner TiAl3/TiAl2/TiNiAl2layer. The coated TiAl was oxidized in air for up to 3600 ks under thermal cycling between room temperature and 1173 K. A protective Al2O3scale formed with little oxide exfoliation and the oxidation amount was 8 g/m2after the 3600 ks oxidation. During oxidation at 1173 K the as-coated layer structure changed from an outer Ni2Al3and inner TiAl3/TiAl2/TiNiAl2layers to an outer $\beta$-NiAl and inner TiAl2and TiNiAl2layers with voids in the outer layer. The voids appear to be formed by the phase change from the Ni2Al3to $\beta$-NiAl during oxidation. A part of the Ti-Al-Ni phase diagram at 1173 K was developed experimentally and it was shown that the solubility limits of Ti into both the Ni2Al3and $\beta$-NiAl phases were less than 0.5at.{\%}. The coating with more Al in the inner layer that in the outer layer would be formed by inward diffusion of Al, caused by a so-called up-hill diffusion phenomenon. The higher Al content in the inner layer was retained after 3600 ks oxidation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract We present dislocation simulations involving the collective behavior of partials and extended full dislocations in nanocrystalline materials. While atomistic simulations have shown the importance of including partial dislocations in high strain rate simulations, the behavior of partial dislocations in complex geometries with lower strain rates has not been explored. To account for the dissociation of dislocations into partials we include the full representation of the gamma surface for two materials: Ni and Al. During loading, dislocation loops are emitted from grain boundaries and expand into the grain interiors to carry the strain. In agreement with high strain rate simulations we find that Al has a higher density of extended full dislocations with smaller stacking fault widths than Ni. We also observe that configurations with smaller average grain size have a higher density of partial dislocations, but contrary to simplified analytical models we do not find a critical grain size below which there is only partial dislocation-mediated deformation. Our results show that the density of partial dislocations is stable in agreement with in situ X-ray experiments that show no increase of the stacking fault density in deformed nanocrystalline Ni (Budrovic et al., 2004). Furthermore, the ratio between partial and extended full dislocation contribution to strain varies with the amount of deformation. The contribution of extended full dislocations to strain grows beyond the contribution of partial dislocations as the deformation proceeds, suggesting that there is no well-defined transition from full dislocation- to partial dislocation-mediated plasticity based uniquely on the grain size.},

abstract = {We present the orientation dependent indentation response of pure magnesium during single grain indentation. A conical indenter and maximum loads between 50 mN and 900 mN were employed. Indent topographies were acquired by confocal microscopy. The indents were also characterized by electron backscatter orientation microscopy for their microstructures. Pronounced activation of specific twinning systems was observed around the impressions. The resulting data were compiled into the inverse pole figure presentation of indent microstructures and topographies after Zambaldi and Raabe, Acta Mater. (2010). Three-dimensional crystal plasticity finite element simulation of the indentation deformation supports the interpretation of the orientation dependent slip and twinning patterns around the indents. The match between the activation of observed and simulated twinning variants is discussed with respect to the conditions for nucleation and growth of extension twins. Furthermore, the compatibility of the twinning strains with the imposed deformation is discussed based on the expanding cavity model of indentation. The orientation dependent response of magnesium during indentation is compared to the literature data for indentation of alpha-titanium and beryllium. Recommendations are given on how to exploit the characteristic nature of the observed indentation patterns to rapidly assess the relative activity of deformation mechanisms and their critical shear stresses during alloy development.},

Ferritic-pearlitic steel pipes are welded with two passes, resulting in a characteristic residual stress state with high tensile residual stresses at the weld root. Four-point bending is applied to generate axial load stress causing changes in the residual stress state. These are determined both on the outer and inner surfaces of the pipes, as well as in the pipe wall, using X-ray and neutron diffraction. Focusing on the effect of tensile load stress, it is revealed that not only the tensile residual stresses are reduced due to exceeding the yield stress, but also the compressive residual stresses for equilibrium reasons. Furthermore, residual stress relaxation occurs both parallel and perpendicular to the applied load stress.},

abstract = {Intermetallic titanium aluminide alloys based on the ordered face-centred tetragonal $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase represent a good example how fundamental and applied research along with industrial development can lead to a new and innovative class of advanced engineering materials. After almost three decades of intensive R{\&}D activities $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys have matured from "laboratory curiosities" to novel structural light-weight materials which eventually found their applications in aerospace and automotive industries. Their advantage is mainly seen in low density (3.9-4.2 g/cm3), high specific yield strength and stiffness, good oxidation and ignition resistance, combined with good creep properties up to high temperatures. Particularly at temperatures between 600 °C and 800 °C $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys are superior to Ti-based alloys in terms of their specific strength. Compared to the heavier Ni-based alloys below 800 °C, their specific yield strength is at least similar. Therefore, the particular constitution and extremely fine microstructure of these alloys are illustrated by several high-resolution transmission electron micrographs. The mechanical properties seem to be largely affected by the evolution of internal stresses and off-stoichiometric deviations of the majority $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase. Novel experimental approaches are described that could characterize the relevant deformation mechanisms. The combination of these results with the concepts of continuum mechanics and continuum thermodynamics has allowed developing models to describe thermomechanically controlled processes. A selection of such models is introduced and explained in a comprehensive way. While early modeling attempts were successfully undertaken to elucidate selected aspects of physical metallurgy of Ti-Al alloys, many experimental findings, particularly for modern multi-phase alloys based on $\gamma$(TiAl) with rather complex constitution and microstructure are still waiting for explanation.},

TiAl alloys based on Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb (at{\%}) were alloyed with small amounts of Ta, W, and B additions for control of alloy phases and microstructure. The alloys were processed by hot extrusion above and below T$\alpha$, followed by short- and long-term heat treatments at temperatures to 1350 °C in vacuum. The microstructural features in the lamellar structures were characterized by metallography, SEM and TEM, and the mechanical properties were determined by tensile tests at temperatures to 1000 °C. The tensile elongation at room temperature is mainly controlled by the colony size, showing an increase in ductility with decreasing colony size. The yield strength, on the other hand, is sensitive to the interlamellar spacing. Hall-Petch relationships hold well for both yield strength and tensile elongation at room and elevated temperatures. TiAl alloys with refined colony size and ultrafine lamellar structures possess excellent mechanical properties for structural applications at elevated temperatures.},

Due to the complexity of their manufacturing, however, they are still not fully commercialised.

The present work explores the impact of each proposed processing stage on a $\beta$-solidifying, multi-phase Ti-43.5Al-4Nb-1Mo-0.1B (in at.-{\%}) alloy. Texture measurements using synchrotron radiation were conducted and combined with microstructural analyses. The experiments allowed to fundamentally correlate the processing, which included heat treatment steps for balanced mechanical properties, with the evolution of both microstructure and texture. Thereby, the influences of deformation, recovery and recrystallisation, and phase transformations could be identified. The results reveal several options to optimise the material properties within the cost-effective manufacturing route. One option discussed in depth is the layout of the temperature profile in connection with the exploitation of the prevailing phase transformations. The presented findings are expected to improve the future design of $\gamma$-TiAl based sheet manufacturing routes.},

However, strength measurements of nanoscale irradiated specimens have not been previously performed. Here we show that yield strengths approaching macroscopic values are measured from irradiated {\~{}}400 nm-diameter copper specimens. Quantitative in situ nanocompression testing in a transmission electron microscope reveals that the strength of larger samples is controlled by dislocation-irradiation defect interactions, yielding size-independent strengths. Below {\~{}}400 nm, size-dependent strength results from dislocation source limitation. This transition length-scale should be universal, but depends on material and irradiation conditions.

abstract = {Semiempirical interatomic potentials have been developed for Al, $\alpha$−Ti, and $\gamma$−TiAl within the embedded atom method (EAM) formalism by fitting to a large database of experimental as well as ab initio data. The ab initio calculations were performed by the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method within the density functional theory to obtain the equations of state for a number of crystal structures of the Ti-Al system. Some of the calculated LAPW energies were used for fitting the potentials while others for examining their quality. The potentials correctly predict the equilibrium crystal structures of the phases and accurately reproduce their basic lattice properties. The potentials are applied to calculate the energies of point defects, surfaces, and planar faults in the equilibrium structures. Unlike earlier EAM potentials for the Ti-Al system, the proposed potentials provide a reasonable description of the lattice thermal expansion, demonstrating their usefulness for molecular-dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations at high temperatures. The energy along the tetragonal deformation path (Bain transformation) in $\gamma$−TiAl calculated with the EAM potential is in fairly good agreement with LAPW calculations. Equilibrium point defect concentrations in $\gamma$−TiAl are studied using the EAM potential. It is found that antisite defects strongly dominate over vacancies at all compositions around stoichiometry, indicating that $\gamma$−TiAl is an antisite disorder compound, in agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {Micro-indentation has been widely used for testing the mechanical properties of NiTi SMAs. In the present study, large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of nano-indentation on equiatomic NiTi SMA were performed with a 2NN MEAM potential. The temperature- and stress-induced martensitic transformation was simulated, where the phase transformation temperatures were determined and the critical stress for transformation was found to rise with the increase of temperature. The nano-indentation results show that a typical superelasitic recovery occurs during unloading, and the slope of P-L curves increases with the increase of temperature, which can be attributed to the increase of critical stress. The MD simulation results also show that the affect region of phase transformation beneath the indenter tip can be divided into elastic zone, twinned martensitic zone and detwinned martensite zone. Differently orientated martensitic variants appear during loading and most of them recover during unloading. In addition, the influencing region of phase transformation decreases with the increase of temperature and a theoretical explanation was suggested. The morphologies and profiles of indented surfaces were presented, which exhibit sink in during indent and turn into pile-up after unloading once severe plastic deformation occurs during indentation. The MD simulation results are consistent satisfactorily with the experimental results, implying that the present work could lead to a better understanding of the mechanical properties of equiatomic NiTi SMAs at nano-scale.},
