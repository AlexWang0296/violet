abstract = {The properties of small clusters of Lennard-Jones atoms were studied by using molecular dynamics simulations. Clusters containing from 13 to 147 atoms were found to undergo a transition, analogous to a melting transition for bulk materials, from a low-energy solidlike structure at low temperatures to a set of higher energy liquidlike structures at high temperatures. The transition creates noticeable features in plots of the equilibrium energy of clusters as a function of temperature, but the shapes of the curves depend on the size of the cluster and on whether a canonical ensemble or microcanonical ensemble is used for calculating the properties. The nonequilibrium energy as a function of temperature on heating or cooling at a finite rate can differ significantly from the equilibrium results. Coexistence among the minimum-energy structure, high-energy liquidlike structures, and typically one or more intermediate structures was observed over a range of temperatures. Results from potential energy minimization of fcc and icosahedral structures of various sizes indicate that a Lennard-Jones cluster must contain at least 5000 atoms before the fcc structure becomes more stable than the structure of the Mackay icosahedra.},

@article{Stukowski2010,
abstract = {The Open Visualization Tool (OVITO) is a new 3D visualization software designed for post-processing atomistic data obtained from molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations. Unique analysis, editing and animations functions are integrated into its easy-to-use graphical user interface. The software is written in object-oriented C++, controllable via Python scripts and easily extendable through a plug-in interface. It is distributed as open-source software and can be downloaded from the website http://ovito.sourceforge.net/.},

@article{Faken1994,
abstract = {The implementation of a method for systematic analysis of local atomic structure in combination with 3D computer graphics is described. The method, Common Neighbor Analysis, is a decomposition of the radial distribution function according to the local environment of the pairs of atoms and can provide direct interpretation of various features of the radial distribution function in terms of atomic structure. It can also be used to identify atoms in particular environment, such as FCC, HCP, BCC or icosahedral. We describe an application of this program to a study of crystal nucleation in a molten Cu slab. While the majority of atoms in the resulting crystals are classified as being FCC, stacking faults are observed and can be traced back to the near-critical nuclei. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Kelchner1998,
abstract = {We model indentation of a metal surface by combining an atomistic metal with a hard-sphere indenter. This work provides atomistic imaging of dislocation nucleation during displacement controlled indentation on a passivated surface. Dislocations and defects are located and imaged by local deviations from centrosymmetry. For a Au(111) surface, nucleation of partial dislocation loops occurs below the surface inside the indenter contact area. We compare and contrast these observations with empirical criteria for dislocation nucleation and corresponding continuum elasticity solutions.},

abstract = {We discuss existing and new computational analysis techniques to classify local atomic arrangements in large-scale atomistic computer simulations of crystalline solids. This article includes a performance comparison of typical analysis algorithms such as common neighbor analysis (CNA), centrosymmetry analysis, bond angle analysis, bond order analysis and Voronoi analysis. In addition we propose a simple extension to the CNA method that makes it suitable for multi-phase systems. Finally, we introduce a new structure identification algorithm, the neighbor distance analysis, which is designed to identify atomic structure units in grain boundaries.},
