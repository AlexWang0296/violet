abstract = {A method combining experiment and simulation was used in this paper to study the effects of warm laser peening (WLP) on the residual stress relaxation (RSR) in Ti6Al4V titanium alloy. Moreover, the effects of RSR on fatigue properties and its mechanism were both revealed. Laser peening experiments were conducted at room temperature (RT-LP) and elevated temperature (300 °C-WLP). Then the yield strengths of specimens were obtained through tensile experiments and their improvement induced by WLP was analyzed by microstructures. A finite element analysis was used to research the effects of RT-LP and 300 °C-WLP on the RSR during fatigue. Finally, the fatigue life and fracture microstructures were both measured and analyzed. The results indicate that the severe plastic strain induced by 300 °C-WLP results in lots of crossed acicular $\alpha$ phases with a short spacing, which promotes the interactions between $\alpha$ phases and leads to an increasing dislocation density. Therefore, the yield strength of 300 °C-WLPed specimens is much greater than RT-LPed samples based on the Hall-Petch relations. Besides, the simulated results show that the extended yield strength of 300 °C-WLPed specimens significantly decreases the d$\sigma$/d$\epsilon$ during fatigue and thus reduces the relaxation of CRS. Moreover, it can be found that the fatigue life of 300 °C-WLPed specimens is subjected to an significant increase, which can be attributed to the increasing finished crack lengths and the decreasing RSR.},

abstract = {The sizes of most asperities on actual rough surfaces range from nanometers to microns. Recent investigations reveal that surface tension plays an important role in micro-/nano-sized contact. Therefore, in this paper, we address the influence of surface tension on the elastic contact of rough surfaces. Nayak's model is employed to describe rough surface with stochastic distribution of both heights and curvatures. As a fundament, we present the general relations of contact area and load as the function of indent depth for a single micro-/nano-sized asperity by accounting for surface tension. Based on the refined relations, we derive the general relations concerned in the contact of rough surfaces. Compared with the conventional multi-asperity contact models based on the Hertzian contact theory, the existence of surface tension decreases the real contact area and requires higher load to generate a given indent depth. It is found that the area of intimate contact is still approximately proportional to the external load, but the proportionality depends on the surface tension.},

abstract = {The structural relaxation of crystalline nitromethane initially at T = 200 K subjected to moderate ({\~{}}15 GPa) supported shocks on the (100), (010), and (001) crystal planes has been studied using microcanonical molecular dynamics with the nonreactive Sorescu-Rice-Thompson force field [D. C. Sorescu, B. M. Rice, and D. L. Thompson, J. Phys. Chem. B 104, 8406 (2000)]. The responses to the shocks were determined by monitoring the mass density, the intermolecular, intramolecular, and total temperatures (average kinetic energies), the partitioning of total kinetic energy among Cartesian directions, the radial distribution functions for directions perpendicular to those of shock propagation, the mean-square displacements in directions perpendicular to those of shock propagation, and the time dependence of molecular rotational relaxation as a function of time. The results show that the mechanical response of crystalline nitromethane strongly depends on the orientation of the shock wave. Shocks propagating along [100] and [001] result in translational disordering in some crystal planes but not in others, a phenomenon that we refer to as plane-specific disordering; whereas for [010] the shock-induced stresses are relieved by a complicated structural rearrangement that leads to a paracrystalline structure. The plane-specific translational disordering is more complete by the end of the simulations ({\~{}}6 ps) for shock propagation along [001] than along [100]. Transient excitation of the intermolecular degrees of freedom occurs in the immediate vicinity of the shock front for all three orientations; the effect is most pronounced for the [010] shock. In all three cases excitation of molecular vibrations occurs more slowly than the intermolecular excitation. The intermolecular and intramolecular temperatures are nearly equal by the end of the simulations, with 400-500 K of net shock heating. Results for two-dimensional mean-square molecular center-of-mass displacements, calculated as a function of time since shock wave passage in planes perpendicular to the direction of shock propagation, show that the molecular translational mobility in the picoseconds following shock wave passage is greatest for [001] and least for the [010] case. In all cases the root-mean-square center-of-mass displacement is small compared to the molecular diameter of nitromethane on the time scale of the simulations. The calculated time scales for the approach to thermal equilibrium are generally consistent with the predictions of a recent theoretical analysis due to Hooper [J. Chem. Phys. 132, 014507 (2010)].},

This paper presents a fully nonlinear treatment of surface stress and surface elastic constants. Amethod for the determination of surface elastic properties from atomistic simulations is developed. This method is illustrated with examples of several crystal faces of some fcc metals modeled with embedded atom potentials. The key finding in this study is the importance of accounting for the additional relaxations of atoms at the crystal surface due to strain. Although these relaxations do not affect the values of surface stress as had been determined in previous works, they have a profound effect on the surface elastic constants. Failure to account for these relaxations can lead to values of elastic constants that are incorrect not only in magnitude but also in sign.

Contributions to the strain from the various mechanisms of plastic deformation such as partial dislocations, perfect dislocations and twins are quantified in the nc samples. The effect of stress unloading, a phenomenon often neglected in MD simulations, on dislocation behavior is computed. It is shown that a large fraction of the dislocations generated during compression is annihilated upon unloading. The present analysis resolves a disagreement consistently observed between MD computations and experimental results. Analytical models are applied to predict the critical pressures for the cell-to-stacking-fault transition and the onset of twinning as a function of grain-size and stacking-fault energy (through the addition of tungsten).

@article{Farshi2010,
abstract = {Consideration of surface effects in microscaled and nanoscaled materials
is important for accurate prediction of their dynamic behavior. In this
study, the Timoshenko beam model is modified to include the surface
effects and used to analyze the vibration of nanotubes as well as
calculate their natural frequencies. The thin surface layers have been
taken into account for rotary inertia computation. Through an example it
is shown that dynamic behavior of nanoscaled tubes with consideration of
surface effects considerably deviates from the results obtained by
classical theories. Plots illustrating such deviations are given to
support the conclusions.},
