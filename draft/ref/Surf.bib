abstract = {In the present paper, the multiple diffraction of plane harmonic compressional$\backslash$nwaves (P-wave) by two nanosized circular cylindrical holes embedded$\backslash$nin an elastic solid is investigated. The surface elasticity theory$\backslash$nis adopted to account for the effect of surface energy at nanoscales.$\backslash$nIt is found that when the radii of holes reduce to nanometers, surface$\backslash$nenergy significantly affects the diffraction of elastic waves. The$\backslash$ndynamic stresses around the holes under incident waves of different$\backslash$nfrequencies are examined to display the influence of surface energy$\backslash$nand the interaction between holes in the multiple scattering phenomena.$\backslash$n(C) 2009 American Institute of Physics. {\{}[{\}}DOI: 10.1063/1.3054517]},
