abstract = {Rapid solidification process is an effective method to improve the corrosion behavior of Mg alloys. In the present study, laser melting, as a typical rapid solidification process, was used to fabricate Mg–5.6Zn–0.5Zr (ZK60). With the increase of laser energy density, the crystalline structures experienced successive changes: clustered finer dendrites→uniform equiaxed grains→coarsened equiaxed grains. Moreover, the fully divorced eutectic $\alpha$-Mg + Mg7Zn3homogeneously distributed along the boundaries of solid solution structure $\alpha$-Mg. Meanwhile, at a laser energy density of 600 J/mm3, ZK60 was dense with an optimal hardness of 89.2 Hv and hydrogen evolution rate of 0.006 ml cm−2 h−1. The enhanced corrosion resistance was attributed to the refined grain, homogenized microstructure and extended solid solution caused by laser rapid solidification.},

abstract = {Abstract Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to study the fracture behaviors of several symmetric tilt grain boundaries in $\gamma$-TiAl bicrystals with {\textless}110{\textgreater} misorientation axes. Tensile deformation along direction perpendicular to grain boundary was simulated under various strain rates and temperatures. The results indicate that the relative orientation of the grains and the presence of certain atom units are two critical factors of the interface structure affecting the stress required for dislocation nucleation. Dislocations nucleate and extend at or near the symmetric tilt grain boundaries during the tensile deformation of $\Sigma$3 (111) 109.5°, $\Sigma$9 (221) 141.1°and $\Sigma$27 (552) 148.4°interfaces. For $\Sigma$27 (115) 31.6°and $\Sigma$11 (113) 50.5°interfaces, the interfaces fractured directly in a cleavage manner due to no dislocation emitted from the boundary. The tensile fracture mechanisms of the bicrystals are that micro-cracks nucleate at the grain boundary and propagate along the interface. The variance of crack propagation is whether there is accommodation of plastic region at the crack tips.},

abstract = {BiVO4/WO3heterojunction film is considered as a very promising candidate for photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, the BiVO4/WO3films prepared by a conventional method exhibit numerous grain boundaries in the BiVO4layer and a weak contact at the heterojunction interface. In this paper, we found that BiVO4could be formed from hydrothermal Bi2WO6in the weak acid solution dissolving V2O5and successfully developed an in situ transformation method to prepare BiVO4/WO3heterojunction films. The prepared BiVO4/WO3heterojunction films were characterized in detail and showed a high quality core/shell WO3/BiVO4structure. The formation mechanism of the BiVO4layer on the surface of WO3film has been put forward. In particular, the prepared BiVO4/WO3films were used as photoanodes and showed an excellent visible light response, a good photostability and high photoelectrochemical activity. The photocurrent density for BiVO4/WO3photoanode was up to 2.92 mA cm−2at 1.81 VRHEwithout additional electrocatalyst or doping under visible light illumination.},

abstract = {The dynamic recrystallization behavior of 7085 aluminum alloy during hot compression at various temperatures (573–723 K) and strain rates (0.01–10 s−1) was studied by electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD), electro-probe microanalyzer (EPMA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is shown that dynamic recovery is the dominant softening mechanism at high Zener–Hollomon (Z) values, and dynamic recrystallization tends to appear at low Z values. Hot compression with ln Z=24.01 (723 K, 0.01 s−1) gives rise to the highest fraction of recrystallization of 10.2{\%}. EBSD results show that the recrystallized grains are present near the original grain boundaries and exhibit similar orientation to the deformed grain. Strain-induced boundary migration is likely the mechanism for dynamic recrystallization. The low density of Al3Zr dispersoids near grain boundaries can make contribution to strain-induced boundary migration.},

abstract = {A comparison has been made on the dynamic recrystallization (DRX), texture, and mechanical properties of the Mg-5.5Gd-4.4Y-1.1Zn-0.5Zr (wt{\%}) alloys extruded with different ratios (ER, 36 and 7.1). Intragranular long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) phases strongly restrict the DRX by restraining the lattice rotation of $\alpha$-Mg grains and hindering the migration of the boundaries of DRX-ed grains. Extrusion with ER of 36 can widely break the intragranular LPSO phases and create a fully DRX-ed microstructure with a relatively random texture, while the lower ER of 7.1 fails to break the LPSO and leads to a bimodal microstructure with a strong basal fiber texture. Finer DRX-ed grains and smaller LPSO phases account for the superior tensile yield strength and elongation of the ER36 alloy. However, the ultimate tensile strength of the ER7.1 alloy catches up because its larger grain size causes an increase in the strain hardening rate.},

abstract = {The effects of oxygen contents and sintering time on the sintering-neck growth behaviour of Fe–15Cr powder were studied. The oxygen content was increased from 0.029 to 0.059 wt{\%} by heat-treating the powder under air at different temperatures. SEM observations revealed that the length of the neck decreased as the oxygen content increased. The sintering-neck growth rate decreased most significantly when the oxygen content was increased from 0.029 to 0.034 wt{\%}. The results of electron probe microanalysis suggested that the increase in oxygen content led to encapsulation of the powder particles by oxide films, but the oxygen content inside the sintering neck remained similar to that of the matrix. Theoretical analysis indicated that the growth of sintering necks was hindered by surface oxides and interstitial oxygen in the matrix. When the oxygen content was 0.029 wt{\%}, the sintering necks grew via surface diffusion; when the oxygen content exceeded 0.034 wt{\%}, the dominant sintering mechanism changed to grain-boundary diffusion. The diffusion coefficient of surface diffusion was 2.41 × 10−7m2/s, which far exceeded that of grain-boundary diffusion; when the oxygen content was 0.034 wt{\%}, the diffusion coefficient of grain-boundary diffusion was only 5.79 × 10−9m2/s. It was also found that grain-boundary diffusion required the breaking of Fe–O bonds, so the diffusion coefficient gradually decreased to 1.12 × 10−9m2/s when the oxygen content was 0.059 wt{\%}. The findings of this work will provide a theoretical basis for the optimisation of sintering processes of stainless steel with high oxygen level, such as the metal injection moulding process.},

abstract = {The microstructure and mechanical anisotropy of the hot rolled Mg-8.1Al-0.7Zn-0.15Ag (wt{\%}) sheets were investigated. Dynamic precipitation and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) are the main features of the microstructures. Compared with the sheet rolled at 673 K, the sheet rolled at 633 K exhibits higher level of dynamic precipitates, finer grain size, more uniform microstructure and better strength. TEM observations reveal that the spherical Mg17Al12phases which precipitate dynamically do not possess specific orientation with the matrix. Meanwhile, the migration of dynamic recrystallized (DRXed) grain boundaries is retarded by the pinning of fine particles, thereby leading to a remarkable grain refinement. DRX within the compression twins only appear in the alloy sheet rolled at 673 K and give rise to a weakened basal texture. The study on mechanical anisotropy behavior suggests that the reduced anisotropy of the sheet rolled at 633 K may ascribe to the activation of prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip due to the presence of Mg17Al12phases.},

abstract = {Microstructural aspects have fundamental influences on the fatigue crack characteristics of materials. In this paper, effects of inclusions, grain boundaries (GBs) and grain orientations on the fatigue crack initiation and propagation behavior in a 2524-T3 aluminum alloy have been investigated using in-situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) fatigue testing and electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD). The results show that, potential fatigue cracks tend to nucleate along coarse and closely spaced inclusion particles or high-angle GBs. Coarse inclusion particles drastically accelerate local crack growth rates. A model of series crack growing stages is given based on the observation of initiation and growth of cracks at the inclusion region. GBs serve to impede the crack tip from propagation and cause large angle crack deflections, which greatly affects local crack propagation behaviors. In addition, fatigue crack shows a strong tendency to propagate transgranularly grains with high Schmid factors (SFs) and avoid grains with low SFs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In solid-state electrolytes, the large resistance at grain boundaries remains the bottleneck for high ionic conductivity. Here we develop an alternative and somewhat counterintuitive strategy to enhance their ionic conductivity via non-equilibrium microstructure. Using Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3as an example, we demonstrate that semi-crystalline interphase between well crystallized ceramic phase and amorphous glass phase can be induced by spark plasma sintering, resulting in total ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10−3S cm−1without any doping, which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that derived by the conventional method. It is further demonstrated that the non-equilibrium structure is stable in ambient condition, yet can be converted into equilibrium structure by annealing with higher crystallinity but much lower ionic conductivity, proving that the non-equilibrium structure is indeed the key to the high performance. This opens door for its applications in electric vehicles, and the strategy is applicable to other ionic systems as well.},

A novel dislocation-based strain nucleus model and a Green's function method, which are applicable to any material with local transformations in which elastic properties are reasonably approximated as isotropic, are specifically employed to model the concentrated transformed strain and calculate the local stress field resulting from deformation twinning and the stress intensity factors at crack tips in the magnesium alloys, respectively. In addition, an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurement is provided for crack nucleation originating from Type I co-zone tensile twin intersection. The theoretical modeling indicates: (i) the local strains within barrier twins strongly dictate the growth of incident twins and enhance the twin propagation stress; (ii) larger grains favor brittle fracture. More specifically, the dislocation reactions and pile-ups at the junctions between tensile twins can result in interfacial crack nucleation and growth along the twin boundaries, which is a brittle fracture mode based on lower twinning stress and stress concentration in the coarse-grained magnesium alloys; and (iii) the direction of crack propagation is easily changed by high-density twin bands and twin intersections owing to the local strains.},

Electron backscatter diffraction characterizations are used to obtain spatial distribution of voids, GB misorientation, and grain orientation associated with twins and intragranular voids. Intragranular voids are smaller in size but larger in number than intergranular voids, and nucleate in the GB vicinities. Smaller grains are favorable for the formation of intergranular and intragranular voids. At higher shock pressure, intragranular voids increase in fraction and tend to distribute at grain centers. Deformation twinning depends on grain orientation and prefers to form at high-angle GBs. However, intragranular voids have negligible dependence on grain orientation and favor medium-angle GBs, and the preference is enhanced slightly with increasing impact velocity and decreasing grain size. The simulations show GB-induced multiple-slip, slip-slip intersections and strain localizations act as the prerequisites to intragranular void formation.},

abstract = {To discuss an effect of stress ratio on high cycle fatigue properties of the extruded magnesium alloy, axial loading fatigue tests have been performed under three conditions of stress ratio, R, of 0, -1 and -1.5 in laboratory air at ambient temperature using hourglass shaped specimens of extruded AZ61 magnesium alloy. Clear fatigue limit existed on the S-N curve obtained from the testing condition of R = 0, while under the tests of R = -1 and -1.5, specimens showed a step-wise S-N curve on which two knees appear. From the detailed observation with a SEM, fracture surface was divided characteristic five regions depending on the applied stress amplitude level. Facet-like smooth area was observed at crack origin only under low stress amplitude level and long fatigue life regime of R = -1 and -1.5, and whole stress amplitude level of R = 0. Fatigue crack initiation mechanism changed from the twin-induced failure mode at high stress amplitude level to the slip-induced one at low stress amplitude level. This transition was occurred by the relation between the minimum stress during a cycle and the offset 0.2{\%} compressive yield stress at which deformation twin occurred. The deformation twin is formed during fatigue process when the minimum stress exceeds the yield stress in compression that is smaller than that in tension. It was pointed out that the high cycle fatigue properties were strongly affected by the formation of twin due to anisotropy of the materials processed with extrusion and crystallographic nature.},

abstract = {A monoclinic carbon crystal, M585, consisting of ABCA-stacked cubic-diamond-segments interlinked by interfacial zigzag carbon chains is proposed based on first-principles calculations. The formed linear 5-8-5 carbon grain boundary shows a totally new topological manner of carbon phase, which is distinct from those in the previously proposed 4+8 and 5-7-5 types. M585 is energetically more favorable than the previously proposed M-carbon, W-carbon, H-carbon and S-carbon and is dynamically stable. The calculations on electronic and mechanical properties of M585 indicate that it is optically transparent and mechanically superhard, which has potential applications in mechanical industry. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Al-Cu alloy bars were subjected to electromagnetic upsetting. The microstructural evolution of the adiabatic shear band (ASB) was characterized and revealed. The results showed that multiple slip systems were activated at high strain rates and contribute to the formation of ASB. Dynamic nucleation particles in the boundary of slip bands were formed under the continuous dynamic recrystallization mechanism. In addition, equiaxed dynamic recrystallization grains were produced by a rotating dynamic recrystallization mechanism.},

abstract = {(Na1-xKx)0.5Bi0.5TiO3(NBT-KBT-100x) thin films with different potassium contents (x=0.15, 0.18, 0.20, 0.25) were fabricated on LaNiO3/SiO2/Si(100) substrate by metal-organic decomposition, and the effects of potassium content on piezoelectric, dielectric, and mechanical properties of the thin films were investigated by scanning probe microscopy, impedance analyzer, and nanoindenter, respectively. The residual stress was evaluated by the orientation average method to clarify the dependence on potassium content, and it is used to understand the piezoelectric enhancement mechanism. Among the thin films, NBT-KBT-15 thin film is of the largest piezoelectric coefficient of 95 pm/V, dielectric constant of 240, elastic modulus of 203.61 GPa, and hardness of 12.36 GPa while NBT-KBT-25 thin film is of the largest residual compressive stress 270 MPa. The enhanced electrical properties are attributed to coexistent phases, fine grain, and lattice mismatch, respectively.},

abstract = {A unit cell including the matrix, precipitation free zone (PFZ) and grain boundary was created, and the extended finite element method (XFEM) was used to simulate the growth behaviors of crack at grain boundary under uniaxial tensile load condition. The effects of PFZ width, particle shape, particle size, yield stress, mechanical properties of PFZ on intergranular fracture were simulated. Simulation results show that the crack extends as plane expansion under uniaxial tensile load, and the shape of crack gradually turns to be a circle. The existence of PFZ can reduce the stress intensity at grain boundary, and the failure strain of material is enhancing with the width of PFZ increasing, but the failure strain of the material without PFZ may be improved because there is no deformation localization around grain boundary. Because the crack extends as plane expansion, the crack growth in short direction is affected by the crack size in long direction, and the crack shape plays a role in influencing the crack growth direction and crack growth velocity. The increasing of yield stress in matrix makes the intergranular failure strain drop. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
