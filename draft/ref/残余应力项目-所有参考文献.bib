abstract = {The effects of compressive residual stress on short fatigue crack growth in Inconel 718 have been investigated. Using two different indentation procedures, controlled plane-strain compressive residual stress fields were applied to short through-thickness cracks, which had been generated by machining away wakes of long cracks that had been grown down to threshold levels at a stress ratio of 0.1. Short fatigue crack growth tests were conducted at stress ratios of 0.1 and 0.7. At a stress ratio of 0.1, the residual stress-free testpieces demonstrated typical short fatigue crack growth behaviour, indicated by a reduction of threshold value and increases in fatigue crack growth rates compared to those of long fatigue cracks. A significant decrease in short crack growth rates was observed within the compressive residual stress region of indented testpieces, together with an increase of threshold values. At a high stress ratio of 0.7, any similar decrease in rate is barely observable. This indicates that the effects of compressive residual stress on short fatigue crack growth are monotonic in sign and could perhaps be simulated by a crack closure approach similar to that applied for long fatigue cracks. However the superposition principle which incorporates the compressive residual stress as a negative stress intensity factor, despite many successful applications to long fatigue cracks, is found to be inappropriate here. Hence one should be cautious when extending such a methodology to short fatigue cracks as it may result in optimistic life estimations.},

abstract = {In situ ultrasonic fatigue with a cyclic frequency of 20 kHz was employed in an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to characterize fatigue crack formation and growth in the near alpha titanium alloy Ti-6242S. The role of environment on small fatigue crack initiation and growth was investigated in vacuum and in variable pressures of saturated water vapor, as well as in laboratory air. Small crack growth behavior from cracks initiated at FIB-produced micro-notches indicated a significant environmental dependence, with fatigue crack growth rates increasing with increasing partial pressures of water vapor. Environment also influenced crack initiation lifetime in that cracks initiated earlier in laboratory air than in vacuum or saturated water vapor environments. Transgranular, crystallographic crack growth was observed in each environment, with the crack path in primary $\alpha$ grains producing facets parallel to basal planes when crack size was small. Small crack growth resistance had a marked sensitivity to microstructural features, such as $\alpha$/$\alpha$ grain boundaries with high misorientation and $\alpha$/$\alpha$ + $\beta$ boundaries. These initial investigations demonstrate the usefulness of in situ ultrasonic fatigue instrumentation (UF-SEM) as a new tool for the characterization of environmental and microstructural influences on very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) behavior.},

abstract = {The three-part paper deals with energy-minimal multiple crack propagation in a linear elastic solid under quasi-static conditions. The principle of minimum total energy, i.e. the sum of the potential and fracture energies, which stems directly from the Griffith's theory of cracks, is applied to the problem of arbitrary crack growth in 2D. The proposed formulation enables minimisation of the total energy of the mechanical system with respect to the crack extension directions and crack extension lengths to solve for the evolution of the mechanical system over time. The three parts focus, in turn, on (I) the theory of multiple crack growth including competing cracks, (II) the discrete solution by the extended finite element method using the minimum-energy formulation, and (III) the aspects of computer implementation within the Matlab programming language. The Part-II of our three-part paper examines three discrete solution methods for solving fracture mechanics problems based on the principle of minimum total energy. The suitability of each solution approach is determined by the stability property of the fracture configuration at hand. The first method is based on external load-control. It is suitable for stable crack growth and stable fracture configurations. The second method is based on fracture area-control (or length-control in 2D). This method is applicable to stable or unstable fracture growth but the fracture front must be stable. The third solution method is based on a gradient-descent. Although the method is aimed at solving general crack growth problems, its weak point is that the converged solution cannot be guaranteed to be optimal in the particular case of competing crack growth and an unstable fracture front configuration. Nonetheless, the main focus is on the implementation and application of the gradient-descent solution approach within the framework of the extended finite element method. Concerning the aforementioned case of competing crack growth, an alternative solution strategy is pursued to supplement the gradient-descent approach. The proposed method, however, is only a proof of concept since its robustness is assessed by solving fabricated benchmark problems. The open-source Matlab code, documentation and example cases are included as supplementary material.},

The materials were prepared with a varying amount of a silica sintering aid, which resulted in the formation of a glassy secondary phase at the grain boundaries. Crystalline mullite was additionally found in the material with the highest silica content. The biaxial strength, measured by Ball-on-Ring and Ball-on-3-Balls, was highest for the material without mullite at the grain boundaries, and the biaxial strength decreased with increasing porosity. The fracture toughness of the materials was in the range of 1.7–1.9 MPa m0.5. Measurements of subcritical crack growth by a modified lifetime method in air and aqueous environments demonstrated a higher crack growth rate in water and acid relative to in air.

The influence of early production stages is revealed as the residual stress integral along the depth range mostly subjected to relaxation. Named as Unstable Area of Residual Stress (UARS), it was verified between machining and heat treatment, and between shot peening and grinding.

Crack propagation behaviour was sensitive to both weld orientation and the distance of the crack from the weld line. Growth rates both faster and slower than in the parent material were observed, depending on the crack orientation and distance from the weld. Weld residual stress was mechanically relieved and the effects on crack propagation observed. A comparative analysis of the results indicated that crack growth behaviour in the FSW joints was generally dominated by the weld residual stress and that microstructure and hardness changes in FSWs had a minor influence. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Ti/Al composite laminates were fabricated using explosive welding method, and the morphology and elemental distribution of the bonding interface were then investigated by means of SEM and EDS. Subsequently, in-situ tensile test results showed that the intermetallic compounds could form at the interface of Ti/Al composite laminates, and also could easily induce the initiation of microcrack under tensile forces. Furthermore, the microcracks almost propagated along the 45{\"{i}}¿½ angle with the tensile direction to Ti layer rather than Al layer. These features of microcracks mainly attributed to the hard and brittle phase (TiAl3) and the plasticity distinction between Ti and Al metals. Finally, the fracture mechanism was mainly about the crack initiation and the stress concentration in the Ti/Al composite laminates.},

Load-controlled fatigue testing was performed with R-ratio of 0.1 and frequency 10 Hz. The maximum applied stress was well below the yield stress of the studied material. The effect of the observed strain field on crack growth rate variation is discussed. Fracture surfaces were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evidencing the connection between the mechanism of the fatigue crack growth, accumulated strain and crack growth rate. Detailed study of fracture surface morphology was carried out by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results indicate two processes of material damage accumulation and failure during cyclic loading: 1) local shear strain zones form successively ahead of the crack tip, and 2) fatigue crack growth occurs by both single- and multiple-slip mechanisms. The place and intensity of shear strain localization zones vary during the crack growth that is related closely to the local variation of crack growth rate.},

Within soft-oriented grains in a microtextured region, pile-up of a slip band within one grain resulted in the direct transfer of slip into an adjacent similarly oriented grain. In contrast, pile up of dislocations in a soft grain with a ‘hard' oriented neighbour resulted in the activation of few non-connected dislocations in the hard grain, with {\textless}a{\textgreater}-type dislocations being activated and the observation of cross-slip. Whilst a high density of dislocations was present from precipitation of secondary alpha in the retained beta ligaments, a little dislocation interaction was observed between the transformed beta and the primary alpha grains.},

@article{RaviChandran2017,
abstract = {An unsolved problem in the mechanics of fatigue crack growth is why mean stress or stress ratio in a fatigue cycle has a profound effect on growth rate when compared in terms of stress intensity factor range ($\Delta$K). Specifically, there has not been any fracture-mechanically-consistent theory to explain the effects of mean stress on fatigue crack growth. In this work, a new and generalized driving force parameter for fatigue crack growth, which effectively incorporates the mean stress or stress ratio effect, is developed from energy principles of solid mechanics. A successful explanation of the effect of mean stress on the growth rate is provided. The driving force is the accumulated change in net-section strain energy, which develops as a function of increasing crack length and decreasing net-section size in fatigue. A generalized mechanics analysis, showing how to account for the stress amplitude and the maximum stress of a fatigue cycle in the change in net-section strain energy, is presented. Equivalently, the new crack growth parameter can also be interpreted as the cumulative work done by cyclic loading at the crack length at which the crack growth data is determined. Several experimental data, including some historically significant fatigue crack growth data, generated on aluminum, steel and titanium alloys, are used to demonstrate the success of the correlation. As a further validation of the proposed concept, it is shown that the empirical Walker parameter ($\Delta$K0.5Kmax0.5), which had some success in correlating stress ratio effect, is in fact related to the change in net-section strain energy.},

abstract = {Fatigue crack propagation tests of Ti-6Al-4V fabricated by the Wire+Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) process are analysed. Crack growth rate and trajectory are examined before and after the crack tip crossing an interface between the WAAM and wrought alloys. The study has focused on the microstructure and residual stress effect. First, the differences in crack growth rate and path between WAAM and wrought alloys are attributed to their different microstructure; the equiaxed wrought alloy has straight crack path, whereas the WAAM lamellar structure causes tortuous crack path resulting in lower crack growth rate. Second, based on measured residual stress profile in the as-built WAAM piece, retained residual stress in the much smaller compact tension specimens and its effect on crack growth rate are calculated by the finite element method. Numerical simulation shows considerable residual stress in the test specimen and the stress magnitude depends on the initial crack location and propagation direction in relation to the WAAM-wrought interface. Residual stress is released immediately if the initial crack is in the wrought substrate; hence it has little effect. In contrast, when crack grows from WAAM to wrought, residual stress is retained resulting in higher stress intensity factor; hence greater crack growth rate.},

Additive manufacturing technologies are increasing in importance for aerospace and medical applications, where the demand for a fundamental understanding and predictability of static and dynamic material properties are high. Ti-6Al-4V is the most widely used and studied alloy for this technology, and is the focus of this work in its Extra Low Interstitial (ELI) variation. The layered manufacturing of metallic components by EBM creates a unique directional microstructure, and consequently, anisotropic properties. Microstructure evolution, and its influence on mechanical properties of the alloy in the as-fabricated condition, has been documented by various researchers. However, fatigue crack propagation and the effects of the directional structure have not been sufficiently studied, imposing a barrier for this technology's potential extension to high-integrity applications. In this study, fatigue crack growth (FCG) both parallel and perpendicular to the build directions was studied for different stress ratios and crack growth stages. The interaction between the directional as-fabricated EBM microstructure and FCG was investigated and compared to that of the equiaxed $\beta$ annealed microstructure obtained by annealing above the $\beta$ transus temperature. The FCG threshold, $\Delta$Kth, was analytically modeled for the two relative crack propagation directions at different stress ratios, and FCG microstructural mechanisms were established for all three regions of crack propagation.},

abstract = {A review is presented of the experimental data on subcritical crack growth in geological materials. The main parameters describing subcritical crack growth are the critical stress intensity factor Kc, the subcritical crack growth limit Ko, and the stress intensity factor-crack velocity (K-v) relationship between Ko and Kc. The K-v data are presented in terms of an equation in which the crack velocity depends on stress intensity factor raised to a power n because this is common practice in experimental studies. These data are presented as tables and in synoptic diagrams. For silicates the value of n increases as the environment becomes depleted in hyroxyl species and with increase in the microstructural complexity of the solid. Values of n as low as 9.5 have been found for tensile cracking of quartz in basic environments and as high as 170 for tensile cracking of basalt in moist air. Insufficient experimental data are available to predict subcritical crack growth behavior at depth in the earth's crust without major extrapolations of the data base. Schematic outlines are presented, therefore, of the probable influence on subcritical crack growth of some key parameters in the crustal environment. These include stress intensity factor, temperature, pressure, activity of corrosive environmental agent, microstructure, and residual strains. In addition, a discussion is presented of the likely magnitude of the subcritical crack growth limit. For stress corrosion tensile crack growth of quartz a limit of approximately 0.2 of the critical stress intensity factor is inferred from theoretical calculations. Further problems discussed with regard to the extrapolation of experimental data to crustal conditions include the choice of a suitable equation to describe crack growth and the magnitude of parameters in these equations. A brief discussion of the double torsion testing method is presented in order to aid the interpretation of experimental results because it is almost the sole method used to study subcritical cracking in rocks.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Publishing Ltd. Under pressurized thermal shock (PTS), once crack initiation occurs in a reactor pressure vessel (RPV), the stress concentration around the crack tips may result in local instability and crack propagation. The temperature-dependent material properties are introduced into the finite element analysis model. According to the response of the transient temperature field and stress field near the crack tip region, the influence of PTS on the carrying capacity of the structure is demonstrated. Also, the process of crack initiation and propagation is simulated by using the extended finite element method (XFEM). The results show that the crack of mode I is easy to be initiated on the nozzle in the initial high temperature and high pressure working state. The effect of cladding on the RPV integrity is enhanced with the increase of crack size, and it mainly depends on the crack length. During the PTS transient, a discontinuity of stress exists near the cladding-base interface, and the cladding bears more loading than the base of the same size. As the unloading of the internal pressure, the stress does not decline due to the strong thermal shock. In the late stage of the PTS process, the internal pressure caused by repressurization poses a challenge to the strength of the structure. With the decrease of the base wall thickness, the allowable repressure value also gradually decreases. However, the increase of the base wall thickness causes the rise of thermal stress, and the allowable repressure load is not significantly improved.},

abstract = {Although laser cladding process has been widely used to improve the wear and corrosion resistance, there are unwanted cracking issues during and/or after laser cladding. This study investigates the tendency of Co-based WC + NiCr composite layers to cracking during the laser cladding process. Residual stress distributions of the specimen are measured using neutron diffraction and elucidate the correlation between the residual stress and the cracking in three types of cylindrical specimens; (i) no cladding substrate only, (ii) cladding with 100{\%} stellite{\#}6, and (iii) cladding with 55{\%} stellite{\#}6 and 45{\%} technolase40s. The microstructure of the clad layer was composed of Co-based dendrite and brittle eutectic phases at the dendritic boundaries. And WC particles were distributed on the matrix forming intermediate composition region by partial melting of the surface of particles. The overlaid specimen exhibited tensile residual stress, which was accumulated through the beads due to contraction of the coating layer generated by rapid solidification, while the non-clad specimen showed compressive. Also, the specimen overlaid with 55 wt{\%} stellite{\#}6 and 45 wt{\%} technolase40s showed a tensile stress higher than the specimen overlaid with 100{\%} stellite{\#}6 possibly, due to the difference between thermal expansion coefficients of the matrix and WC particles. Such tensile stresses can be potential driving force to provide an easy crack path ways for large brittle fractures combined with the crack initiation sites such as the fractured WC particles, pores and solidification cracks. WC particles directly caused clad cracks by particle fracture under the tensile stress. The pores and solidification cracks also affected as initiation sites and provided an easy crack path ways for large brittle fractures.},

However, the drilling industry currently does not have a means of quantitatively evaluating drill-pipe fatigue fife. The aim of the present study is to fill this gap, providing a rapid and easy means of accurately obtaining drill-pipe fatigue life estimates. The geometry considered is the passage of a drill-pipe through a dogleg. It is characterised by a load combination of tension and bending while undergoing rotation. This load–geometry combination is taken as representative of the present-day drilling. The Stress Intensity Factors along the crack front of a semi-elliptical internal crack in a drill-pipe are obtained by means of Multiple Reference States Weight Function approach that is then implemented in a developed MATLAB code. The developed computer code is validated by comparison with data available in the literature and then applied to the geometry of interest. The Stress Intensity Factors thus obtained are then inserted in the Paris Fatigue Crack Growth Model to quantitatively evaluate the drill-pipe fatigue life. Finally, a parametric study is performed in order to identify the influence of load magnitudes, dogleg, crack shape and geometrical parameters on the fatigue life. A detailed discussion of all these effects concludes the paper. It is the contention of the authors that the method can be easily, rapidly and successfully extended to other oilfield tubulars.},

The results of XRD and EDS suggested that laminated structure restrained the interfacial reaction between Ti and B4C phase by confining the contacting area between Ti and B4C layers on interface. As expected, the fracture toughness of the laminated composite reaches to 9.22 ± 1.12 MPa m1/2, which increased by approximately 201{\%} compared with monolithic composite (4.58 ± 0.81 MPa m1/2). This remarkable improvement of fracture toughness was attributed to multiple-layers structure, ductile Ti layers and crack deflection.

An analysis approach for the change in residual stress distribution is established according to the diffusion theory of cavity, which is also used to investigate cracks with different orientations. Experiments are conducted to verify the prediction results of residual stress. A probability density function based on Weibull distribution is established to evaluate the accuracy of predicted residual stress. The influence of residual stress on fatigue crack propagation is considered the effective stress intensity factor range, which is calculated under the combined stress field of applied stress and residual stress. An analysis model of crack propagation is established. Furthermore, the model of crack propagation is used to estimate the velocity of crack propagation for the cases, same as the cases of residual stress prediction.

abstract = {Dynamic crack growth is analysed numerically for a plane strain block with an initial central crack subject to tensile loading. The continuum is characterized by a material constitutive law that relates stress and strain, and by a relation between the tractions and displacement jumps across a specified set of cohesive surfaces. The material constitutive relation is that of an isotropic hyperelastic solid. The cohesive surface constitutive relation allows for the creation of new free surface and dimensional considerations introduce a characteristic length into the formulation. Full transient analyses are carried out. Crack branching emerges as a natural outcome of the initial-boundary value problem solution, without any ad hoc assumption regarding branching criteria. Coarse mesh calculations are used to explore various qualitative features such as the effect of impact velocity on crack branching, and the effect of an inhomogeneity in strength, as in crack growth along or up to an interface. The effect of cohesive surface orientation on crack path is also explored, and for a range of orientations zigzag crack growth precedes crack branching. Finer mesh calculations are carried out where crack growth is confined to the initial crack plane. The crack accelerates and then grows at a constant speed that, for high impact velocities, can exceed the Rayleigh wave speed. This is due to the finite strength of the cohesive surfaces. A fine mesh calculation is also carried out where the path of crack growth is not constrained. The crack speed reaches about 45{\%} of the Rayleigh wave speed, then the crack speed begins to oscillate and crack branching at an angle of about 29° from the initial crack plane occurs. The numerical results are at least qualitatively in accord with a wide variety of experimental observations on fast crack growth in brittle solids. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Friction stir welding (FSW) is being explored as a potential tool for manufacturing aluminum aerospace structures. Several joint configurations, butt, lap and fillet joints have been made in the production of such exploratory structures. Research work on S-N fatigue and fatigue crack growth in the weld zone is required to provide an understanding and tools to assess the damage tolerance issues in friction stir welded joints and structures. In this work, results of a study conducted on near-threshold fatigue crack growth in friction stir welded aluminum alloy 7050-T7451 and a titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V are presented. Tests were conducted on weld coupons as a function of specimen geometry (compact tension, eccentrically loaded single edge and center-crack tension) and stress ratio to understand the effects of residual stresses in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of the alloy. Residual stresses were measured on samples machined from the friction stir welded plates prior to testing. The crack growth results show that residual stresses play a key role in the crack growth parallel to the weld-path in the HAZ. Although friction stir welding process induced low residual stresses in the welds, they are found to produce large effects on the near-threshold fatigue crack growth. In general, the magnitude of the shift in the fatigue threshold in the friction stir welded coupons is a function of microstructure, residual stresses and specimen geometry. However, for a constant microstructure, fatigue thresholds at low stress ratios, were specimen geometry dependent. The thresholds were either higher or lower than those of the parent material. At high stress ratio, the differences due to the specimen geometry vanish. Stress ratio studies show that the center-crack tension geometry is less sensitive to the residual stress effects compared to the compact tension geometry. Crack growth analysis using equivalent residual stresses was used to determine the residual stress intensity factor and predict stress ratio effects. The role of microstructure on the fatigue threshold in the welds is also discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Multiple mechanisms of fatigue crack initiations from pores leading to short-term and long-term fatigue life have been observed in a powder metallurgy (PM) Ti-6Al-4V alloy made by the hydrogen sintering and phase transformations (HSPT) process. The pores in the sintered alloy could be classified into two groups; type-I being caused by particle interstices that did not fully close during sintering (sinter-pores) and the type-II originating from larger voids that did not close during powder packing (cave-pores). The fatigue life trends can be classified by the type and the location of pore from which the crack initiated. Interestingly, the two types of pores, and the two different locations (surface versus interior) from which the cracks initiated lead to four distinct S-N trends in the fatigue data. When the stress amplitude level and the pore size were accounted for through initial stress intensity factors, the fatigue data reduced to dual S-N fatigue curves. The results offer new insights into how pores, especially their type and size, and location control the fatigue behavior of PM Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Large improvements in fatigue life can be obtained if the large cave-pores are eliminated or their volume density reduced to very low levels.},

abstract = {When Staphylococcus aureus undergoes cytokinesis, it builds a septum, generating two hemispherical daughters whose cell walls are only connected via a narrow peripheral ring. We found that resolution of this ring occurred within milliseconds (“popping”), without detectable changes in cell volume. The likelihood of popping depended on cell-wall stress, and the separating cells split open asymmetrically, leaving the daughters connected by a hinge. An elastostatic model of the wall indicated high circumferential stress in the peripheral ring before popping. Last, we observed small perforations in the peripheral ring that are likely initial points of mechanical failure. Thus, the ultrafast daughter cell separation in S. aureus appears to be driven by accumulation of stress in the peripheral ring and exhibits hallmarks of mechanical crack propagation.$\backslash$nPop goes the coccus$\backslash$nDaughter cell separation in Staphylococcus aureus proceeds much like the cracking of an egg. So say Zhou et al., who examined dividing cells with millisecond precision using high-speed videomicroscopy.

The model was simplified to a two-step 2D problem: (i) determination of crack initiation site on the surface plane; (ii) fatigue life evaluation by simulating crack growth on the inside plane. A multiscale model synthesis approach was used to integrate three elemental models of (i) macroscopic finite element analysis, (ii) geometries and spatial distributions of ferrite grains and pearlite colonies, and (iii) crack initiation and growth. The required input data consisted of only (i) microstructural information, (ii) monotonic tensile properties, and (iii) test conditions. Model validation was performed by comparing the experimental results using steels with various volume fractions of pearlite phases and grain sizes. The predicted fatigue lives and limits were in good agreement with the experimental data for all the steels. In addition, the model could accurately simulate the crack growth behavior observed by optical microscopy. The framework of the proposed model may serve as a basis for predicting the fatigue lives of metallic structural materials.},

abstract = {Saw-toothed chips are formed during machining of hardened steel (HRC∞ 60-63). This paper presents a new analytical approach for modelling the chip formation mechanism in hard-turning. It has been observed that the chip formation starts with initiation of a crack at the free surface of the workpiece which further propagates towards the cutting edge of the tool. The crack soon ceases to grow at a point where severe plastic deformation of the material exists under higher level of compressive stresses. The chip segment caught up between the tool rake face and the crack is pushed out while the material in the plastic region just below the base of the crack is displaced along the tool rake face thus forming saw-toothed chips. The direction of crack initiation and propagation are predicted using the surface layer energy/strain energy density criterion. The maximum value of surface layer energy, Yemaxcan be used to evaluate the angle of crack initiation while the strain energy density criterion predicts the corresponding crack propagation angle. Here, the process of chip formation is considered to be a mixed mode crack problem of Mode I and Mode II. The theoretical predictions are verified by the resultant chip contours obtained experimentally. The predictions made are shown to be in good agreement with those measured experimentally. {\textcopyright} 1996 CIRP.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a novel and innovative production technology that can produce complex and lightweight engineering products. In AM components, as in all engineering materials, fatigue is considered as one of the principle causes of unexpected failure. In order to detect, localise and characterise cracks in various material components and metals, acoustic emission (AE) is used as a non-destructive monitoring technique. One of the main advantages of AE is that it can be also used for dynamic damage characterisation and specifically for crack propagation monitoring. In this research, we use AE to monitor the fatigue crack growth behaviour of Ti6Al4V components under four-point bending. The samples were produced by means of AM as well as conventional material. Notched and unnotched specimens were investigated with respect to the crack severity and crack detection using AE. The main AE signal parameters –such as cumulative events, hits, duration, average frequency and rise time– were evaluated and indicate sensitivity to damage propagation in order to lead to a warning against the final fracture occurrence. This is the first time that AE is applied in AM components under fatigue.},

abstract = {Direct manufacturing techniques such as selective laser melting (SLM) enable material efficient production of individual and complex components in a short period of time. But often these components suffer from process induced imperfections, primarily micro-pores and high residual stresses. Under fatigue loading these two kinds of inherent weaknesses lead to premature failure and consequently fairly low performance in many alloys processed by SLM. The fatigue performance of stainless steel 316L has been investigated. Thorough microstructural analyses were carried out using electronoptical techniques and X-ray diffraction in order to shed light on the process-microstructure-property relationships for this alloy. Fatigue property analyses have not been carried out in such depth so far. The results obtained clearly show that 316L is a promising candidate for cyclically loaded parts manufactured by SLM. Primarily attributed to the high ductility directly following SLM processing, the 316L stainless steel shows fatigue properties similar to conventionally processed material in its as-built condition. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {After tensile overloading during fatigue crack growth, retardation of the crack growth rate was significant. Neutron diffraction was employed to examine the evolution of crack-tip residual stress fields during constant-amplitude cyclic loading and during fatigue crack growth following the overload. It was found that the tensile overload induces larger compressive residual stress and zone size near the crack tip in the crack-growth and crack-opening direction. For the maximum crack growth retardation, the largest compressive residual stresses were measured in the region between an overloading point and the current propagating crack tip, for all three of the orthogonal directions. Such large compressive residual stresses in the crack-wake region are thought to reduce the crack tip driving force, thereby retarding the crack propagation rate significantly. Residual stress mapping was performed to examine the effect of the fatigue stress state on the residual stresses in the three different regions from the centerline to the surface, along the through-thickness direction in the compact-tension specimen. Much larger compressive residual stresses were measured at the surface than at mid-thickness. It is thought that larger compressive residual stresses at the surface result from the plane stress condition, resulting in a slower fatigue crack growth rate at the surface of the specimen.},

On the other hand, at stress ranges 1.6 times higher than the threshold values the crack grew in the direction of the initial crack.

abstract = {Total fatigue life performance of high strength titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V manufactured by Additive Manufacturing (AM) based methods such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is of significant interest and has gained much attention recently. Researchers often compare the total fatigue life of materials manufactured from SLM with conventional manufacture, and often the SLM lives are reduced because cracks initiate from “defects” such as porosity or Lack of Fusion (LOF). But for repair and alternative manufacture of complex and critical aerospace structures for example, the crack growth/propagation phase of the fatigue process is also very important and it has not been studied as extensively. The aim of the work presented here was to evaluate and better understand crack propagation under constant amplitude loading in Ti-6Al-4V samples manufactured using SLM with a variety of layer thicknesses and build directions (vertical or horizontal). The “as-manufactured” condition was studied, with no post heat treatment. Cracks typically initiated at LOF features which had a negative impact on the total fatigue life. The focus here was on the crack growth phase. Modelling was performed with a conventional Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics approach using literature data obtained from testing on Compact Tension (C(T)) specimens which were also in the as-manufactured condition with a variety of build directions. The modelling provided a very useful correlation of the data and provided a way of assessing the LOF features in terms of an equivalent initial crack. The crack growth properties of the SLM cases were also compared against literature data for conventionally manufactured material. The work will lead to a better understanding of fatigue crack growth characteristics for components manufactured by AM methods such as SLM. That understanding is an essential requirement for full certification and acceptance into service for critical applications such as aerospace structures.},

The results show that large residual stresses were generated in the dissimilar welded joint and agree well with the indentation measurement results. The fatigue test specimens were cut from the welded sample, and the residual stress relaxed significantly after longitudinal cutting, especially for longitudinal residual stress. Considering the transverse residual stress, the estimated fatigue life is more consistent with the experiment. The residual stress mainly affects the mean stress, rather than the stress amplitude. As the longitudinal residual stress relaxed significantly after cutting, the effect of welding residual stress on fatigue life can be seriously overestimated. The width of fatigue test specimen should be at least 30{\%} of the as-weld sample for fatigue design in consideration of the residual stress relaxation.},

abstract = {The fretting behaviour of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy was studied in a plain cylinder/plane contact configuration under ambient conditions. Inspired by a fretting map approach, a global quantitative methodology is introduced. The transition from partial to gross slip condition was defined through an energy discontinuity analysis. Dominated by adhesion phenomena, the friction coefficient behaviour at the sliding transition is formalized through pressure dependence formulations. The crack nucleation risk under stabilized partial slip condition is expressed through a closed form applying the Crossland's high cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion. Comparison with experiments concludes that the size effect must be considered. An averaged stress approach, based on the identification of an intrinsic representative damage volume, was developed and confirmed by comparing various loading conditions. Integrating both debris formation and debris ejection mechanisms, an energy wear approach is adapted to formalize the fretting wear response under gross slip conditions. Extending the classical Archard's formalism by considering the friction coefficient and sliding amplitude impacts, this wear energy model displays a very good stability through a wide range of pressure, sliding amplitude and test duration conditions. It is finally discussed how the introduction of a restricted number of "constitutive fretting damage variables" can be transposed in FEM codes to model more complex industrial contacts. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ceramics are able to heal cracks and flaws by triggering local sintering (internal cracks) or oxidation reaction (surface cracks) which may induce the recovery of mechanical strength. Crack healing in ceramics, however, is limited to micro-sized cracks and requires elevated temperatures (above 1000°C) and long time periods even up to 100h. In this work we report on accelerated crack healing of a Ti2SnC ceramic which is capable to repair thermal shock induced cracks at a relatively low temperature of 800°C within only 1h. After healing treatment both the low flexural strength and electrical conductivity measured on the damaged material after quenching were almost fully recovered. Furthermore, Ti2SnC exhibits repeatable healing capability which offers a high potential for developing durable ceramics with prolonged lifetime under harsh thermal conditions.},

abstract = {Fatigue crack growth tests were performed on an Al-Cu alloy under specially designed load sequences with a periodic overload cycle. These overloads were either immediately followed by or preceded by underloads of controlled magnitude. Baseline loading magnitude was designed to induce near-threshold conditions well below the Paris Regime. The fatigue fracture surfaces obtained from the tests were subject to fractographic analysis. The study shows that irrespective of their magnitude, underloads preceding tensile overloads do not affect crack growth rate after the overload. However, if the underload follows an overload, it carries a deleterious effect on retardation, whose magnitude is determined by the extent to which the underload drops below baseline cycling level. In either case, observed effects do not seem to have anything to with crack closure, but rather, are attributable to the effect of underloads on near-tip residual stress during baseline cycling that in turn controls threshold stress intensity range. Post-overload crack closure is reduced by crack-tip blunting, but rapidly recovers.},

Different types of cyclic slip irreversibilities in the bulk that eventually lead to the initiation of fatigue cracks are discussed. Examples of trans- and intercrystalline fatigue damage evolution in the low cycle, high cycle and ultrahigh cycle fatigue regimes in mono- and polycrystalline face-centred cubic and body-centred cubic metals and alloys and in different engineering materials are presented, and some microstructural models of fatigue crack initiation and early crack growth are discussed. The basic difficulties in defining the transition from the initiation to the growth of fatigue cracks are emphasized. In ultrahigh cycle fatigue at very low loading amplitudes, the initiation of fatigue cracks generally occupies a major fraction of fatigue life and is hence life controlling.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. Most mechanicians are aware that residual stresses affect fatigue and fracture. Few are aware of the full extent of the effects residual stress have on myriad aspects of those and other structural processes AND of the reverse relationship: fracture concepts are hugely intertwined with residual stress measurements. This talk first reviews the straightforward effect that residual stress has: it acts just like an external load and, depending on the sign, accelerates or retards failure processes. The talk then describes one exemplar less well-known effect: residual stress can make it very difficult to measure true material properties like fracture toughness. The talk then describes the influence of fracture concepts, most notably the mode I stress intensity factor K I , on residual stress measurement. A short and elegant derivation reveals that incremental slitting measurement strain data can be converted to residual stress profiles using a K I analysis and a conceptually simple calibration factor that is independent of the stress distribution. The talk next shows that several error sources for slitting and contour method stress measurements can be directly correlated with the K I caused by residual stress. The talk then lays out Bueckner's superposition principle, the most powerful but misunderstood and mistrusted tool for analyzing stress fields around cracks. Originally developed for fracture mechanics, Bueckner's is used to calculate the K I from residual stresses and to calculate calibration coefficients for hole drilling and slitting. More notably, the contour method for measuring residual stress is a direct experimental embodiment of Bueckner's principle. In fact, we review an experimental demonstration that misfit measurements between mating fracture surfaces can be used to calculate the residual stresses that existed prior to the fracture.},

ZT1 shows a fatigue threshold, $\Delta$K{\textless}inf{\textgreater}th{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, of 2.8 MPa√m, which appears to be related to the onset of shear band nucleation. Three distinct regimes of fatigue crack growth were observed, with different slopes in the da/dN-$\Delta$K curve, attributable to different micromechanisms. In the Paris regime, each fatigue striation on fracture surface is generated by a number of loading cycles, rather than by a single loading cycle. In general, the $\Delta$K{\textless}inf{\textgreater}th{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} of a BMG approximately scales with its fracture toughness. At different levels of $\Delta$K, shear bands appear to play different roles, either facilitating or blunting the crack growth.},

abstract = {In this paper, the gas tungsten-arc welding (GTAW) process of a thin cylinder made of Al6061-T6 alloy was simulated using 3-D finite element model in the ABAQUS code and the induced distribution of residual stress was obtained. Temperature dependent thermo-mechanical properties were considered for the aluminum alloy and for simulating the heat source of tungsten arc welding; Goldak's double ellipsoid model was employed. The numerical simulation method employed for the GTAW process of investigated aluminum material was validated experimentally using the hole drilling method as well. High residual stresses were found around the weld line and HAZ area which can increase the risk of crack initiation and propagation in this region of welded aluminum cylinder. Hence in the second part of this research, a longitudinal semi-elliptical crack was considered in the wall of aluminum cylinder subjected to combined internal pressure and torsional loads and its mixed mode I/II fracture parameters (i.e. KI, KII and T) were determined numerically along the crack front and for different crack geometries. Finally the influence of obtained residual stress field on the computed fracture parameters was reanalyzed using the coupled residual stress/mechanical loading applied to the cylinder. The residual stress field had no effect on the mode II fracture component but the most influence of this factor was observed for mode I stress intensity factor (KI) and the deepest point of 3D elliptical crack.},

abstract = {Brittle fracture in carbon steel has a strong impact on the safety of the structures. Especially, the arresting technology of the running crack is the measure of last resort for ensuring structural integrity. Due to such high importance, many experimental and theoretical studies of brittle crack propagation have been conducted from both mechanical and microstructural viewpoints. It is thought that the elementary step of the brittle fracture of polycrystalline steel is the cleavage in each crystal grain and their connection process. However, the detailed mechanisms of brittle fracture have not been fully understood; for example, it is still unclear why the propagation rate under a large driving force is not increased up to the Rayleigh wave speed. Several difficulties hinder the achievement of a detailed understanding so far: 1) crack propagation is quite rapid, 2) the crystal grain is usually too small (10–100 $\mu$m) to collect sufficient information, 3) the microstructure is very complicated in most case, i.e., containing different phases, microstructures, precipitates and inclusions. In this study, to eliminate such difficulties, 3{\%} silicon steel in which microstructure is the ferrite single phase and the grain size is increased to 4–5 mm is used. This steel can be fractured in a brittle manner, even under ambient temperature. For this steel, by using a high speed camera and strain gauge data with a high sampling rate, the elementary process of brittle crack propagation is elucidated. As a result, it is revealed that the brittle crack propagation rate even in a single-crystal grain is much slower than the Rayleigh wave speed. This seems to be due to the presence of twin deformations and twin boundary cracks in crystal grain as observed on the fracture surface. Using the analysis of electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) data, the mechanism of twin deformation and twin boundary crack is revealed. Additionally, it is shown that the brittle crack propagation rate where the path includes crystal grain boundaries is much slower. This delay seems to be related to the misorientation angle at the GB. By applying our simplified model, the delay effect at the grain boundary can be successfully explained.},

abstract = {The three-part paper deals with energy-minimal multiple crack propagation in a linear elastic solid under quasi-static conditions. The principle of minimum total energy, i.e. the sum of the potential and fracture energies, which stems directly from the Griffith's theory of cracks, is applied to the problem of arbitrary crack growth in 2D. The proposed formulation enables minimisation of the total energy of the mechanical system with respect to the crack extension directions and crack extension lengths to solve for the evolution of the mechanical system over time. The three parts focus, in turn, on (I) the theory of multiple crack growth including competing cracks, (II) the discrete solution by the extended finite element method using the minimum-energy formulation, and (III) the aspects of computer implementation within the Matlab programming language. The key contributions of Part-III of the three-part paper are as follows: (1) implementation of XFEM in Matlab with emphasis on the design of the code to enable fast and efficient computational times of fracture problems involving multiple cracks and arbitrary crack intersections, (2) verification of the minimum energy criterion and comparison with the maximum tension criterion via multiple benchmark studies, and (3) we propose a numerical improvement to the crack growth direction criterion that gives significant gains in accuracy and convergence rates of the fracture paths, especially on coarse meshes.

Strain hardening was determined not to be the major controlling mechanism retarding crack growth after peak over-load, but instead, strain hardening slightly accelerated crack growth for the case when strain hardening was induced prior to crack initiation. Crack growth after peak overload was characterized by: (1) no effect after 20 per cent overload: (2) crack arrest immediately following 70 and 100 per cent overloads; (3) subsequent retarded crack growth rates after 70 and 100 per cent overloads; and (4) retardation but no arrest following 50 per cent overload. The Wheeler model of crack growth retardation was investigated. The physical appearance of post-test fracture surfaces were as hypothesized by the Elber concept of crack closure after overload. The The recovery of an overloaded crack was linear with respect to the constant load amplitude cyclic stress intensity. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {Rolling contact fatigue cracks in rails undergo non-proportional mixed-mode I + II + III, in variable proportions along their front. In order to determine the crack growth thresholds and kinetics in mixed-mode II/III, asymmetric four point bending tests are run on a rail steel with different angles between the crack front and the shearing load, so as to vary the mode mixity ratio. For sufficiently high loading ranges, these tests give rise to coplanar shear-mode crack growth. The effective stress intensity factors (SIFs) are derived by an inverse method from the measured crack face relative displacements. It appears to be 10-70{\%} lower than the nominal SIFs and to allow a reasonable correlation of the measured crack growth rates. The local application, ahead of the crack front, of shear-driven or tension-driven fatigue damage models - after 3D elastic-plastic computations of local stress and strain ranges - allows a successful prediction of crack fronts paths and growth rates.},

abstract = {This work presents a generalization of recently developed continuum phase field models from brittle to ductile fracture coupled with thermo-plasticity at finite strains. It uses a geometric approach to the diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a balance equation for a regularized crack surface and its modular linkage to a multi-physics bulk response developed in the first part of this work. This evolution equation is governed by a constitutive crack driving force. In this work, we supplement the energetic and stress-based forces for brittle fracture by additional forces for ductile fracture. These are related to state variables associated with the inelastic response, such as the amount of plastic strain and the void volume fraction in metals, or the amount of craze strains in glassy polymers. To this end, we define driving forces based on elastic and plastic work densities, and barrier functions related to critical values of these inelastic state variables. The proposed thermodynamically consistent framework of ductile phase field fracture is embedded into a formulation of gradient thermo-plasticity, that is able to account for material length scales such as the width of shear bands. It is applied to two constitutive model problems. The first is designed for the analysis of brittle-to-ductile failure mode transition in the dynamic failure analysis of metals. The second is constructed for a quasi-static analysis of crazing-induced fracture in glassy polymers. A spectrum of simulations demonstrates that the use of barrier-type crack driving forces in the phase field modeling of fracture, governed by accumulated plastic strains in metals or crazing strains in polymers, provide results in very good agreement with experiments.},

abstract = {Fatigue cracking is one of the main failure modes of asphalt pavement. However, the internal growth of cracks in asphalt binder during the fatigue process is still not well understood, which means that the fatigue mechanism itself remains unclear. In this study, the crack lengths and cracking morphology of three types of asphalt binders were analyzed using image analysis methods. The crack growth rule in the asphalt binder was investigated by combining the use of viscoelastic curves and cross-section images. The mechanisms of the asphalt binders were analyzed and a fatigue failure criterion was then developed. The results demonstrate that fatigue crack propagation can be divided into four stages: an incubation period (Stage I), transition period (Stage II), slow growth period (Stage III), and unstable growth period (Stage IV). In Stage I and Stage II, the binder exhibits unstable flow. In Stage III, damage manifests as Type I hairline cracks. In Stage IV, Type II hairline cracks appear and propagate. The fatigue performance of asphalt binders in Stage I and Stage II under controlled-strain mode and controlled-stress mode is the same when equivalent load levels are employed. Eventually, the demarcation point between Stage III and Stage IV is defined as the fatigue evaluation index. This index is independent of load control mode under the same equivalent load levels.},

abstract = {Introduction The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of apical crack initiation and propagation in root dentin after several endodontic procedures. Methods Sixty intact mandibular premolars were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis at 1 mm from the apex, and the apical surface was polished. Thirty teeth were left unprepared and served as a control, and the remaining 30 teeth were instrumented with ProTaper Universal instruments (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) up to size F5. The root canals were filled with the single-cone technique. Gutta-percha was removed with drills of the Rebilda post system (VOCO, Cuxhaven, Germany). Glass fiber-reinforced composite fiber posts were cemented using a dual-cure resin cement. The fiber posts were removed with a drill of the post system. Retreatment was completed after the removal of the gutta-percha. Crack initiation and propagation in the apical surfaces of the samples were examined with a stereomicroscope after each procedure. The absence/presence of cracks was recorded. Logistic regression was performed to analyze statistically the incidence of crack initiation and propagation with each procedure. Results The initiation of the first crack and crack propagation was associated with F2 and F4 instruments, respectively. The logistic regression analysis revealed that instrumentation and F2 instrument significantly affected apical crack initiation (P {\textless}.001). Post space preparation had a significant effect on crack propagation (P =.0004). The other procedures had no significant effects on crack initiation and propagation (P {\textgreater}.05). Conclusions Rotary nickel-titanium instrumentation had a significant effect on apical crack initiation, and post space preparation with drills had a significant impact on crack propagation.},

abstract = {Cracks can occur in the articular cartilage surface due to the mechanical loading of the synovial joint, trauma or wear and tear. However, the propagation of such cracks under different frequencies of loading is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequency of loading on the growth of a pre-existing crack in cartilage specimens subjected to cyclic tensile strain. A 2.26 mm crack was introduced into cartilage specimens and crack growth was achieved by applying a sinusoidally varying tensile strain at frequencies of 1, 10 and 100 Hz (i.e. corresponding to normal, above normal and up to rapid heel-strike rise times, respectively). These frequencies were applied with a strain of between 10–20{\%} and the crack length was measured at 0, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 cycles of strain. Crack growth increased with increasing number of cycles. The maximum crack growth was 0.6 ± 0.3 (mean ± standard deviation), 0.8 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.4 mm at frequencies of 1, 10 and 100 Hz, respectively following 10,000 cycles. Mean crack growth were 0.3 ± 0.2 and 0.4 ± 0.2 at frequencies of 1 and 10 Hz, respectively. However, this value increased up to 0.6 ± 0.4 mm at a frequency of 100 Hz. This study demonstrates that crack growth was greater at higher frequencies. The findings of this study may have implications in the early onset of osteoarthritis. This is because rapid heel-strike rise times have been implicated in the early onset of osteoarthritis.},

This requires the similitude hypothesis to be applicable using a valid crack driving force, which allows the description of the R-ratio effect on the crack growth behavior. Whereas in metals it is common to use the range in the applied stress intensity factor, $\Delta$K, as the crack driving force, in polymeric materials and composites the use of the energy release rate G has been considered and $\Delta$G has been proposed as the crack driving force to ensure the similitude principle.

Three specimen orientations relative to the build direction as well as two different post-build heat treatments were considered. Specimens and test procedures were designed in accordance with ASTM E399 and ASTM E647 standard. The results show that there is a strong influence of post-build processing (heat treated versus 'as built') as well as specimen orientation on the dynamic behaviour of SLM produced Ti6Al4V. The greatest improvement in properties after heat treatment was demonstrated when the fracture plane is perpendicular to the SLM build direction. This behaviour is attributed to the higher anticipated influence of tensile residual stress for this orientation.

abstract = {The introduction of an overload or underload within a constant amplitude loading fatigue test leads to a retardation or acceleration of the Fatigue Crack Growth Rate (FCGR). The understanding of the causes of these effects is essential in the context of variable amplitude fatigue loading, since in principle any loading history can be represented as a sequence of overloads and underloads. In the case of overload, along with some other minor causes, the residual stress changes at the crack tip and crack closure behind the tip can be thought of as the main factors that affect the fatigue crack growth rate. Whilst this has been recognised and accepted for many decades, controversy persists regarding the relative significance and presence of these two effects, and consensus is yet to emerge. The effect of crack closure, when the baseline loading ratio is high enough, can be inhibited so that the main cause of retardation becomes doubtless the residual stress present ahead the crack tip. In the present paper we report our attempt to deconvolve the contributions of crack closure and residual stress on crack retardation following an overload. To accomplish this task we analyse the results of fatigue tests run at two baseline load ratios, namely R=0.1 and R=0.7. At the load ratio of R=0.7 the crack closure effect is not operative, as confirmed by Digital Image Correlation analysis of the crack flanks close to the tip, and post mortem fractographic analysis of crack surfaces. Therefore, for R=0.7 the compressive residual stress region created by the overload ahead of the crack tip is the sole mechanism causing crack retardation. Therefore, for R=0.7 the focus must be placed entirely on the strain field around the crack tip. To this end, line profiles along the crack bisector of elastic strain in the crack opening direction were collected at several stages of crack propagation past the overload using in situ Synchrotron X-ray Powder Diffraction (SXRPD) technique. By performing comparison between the two loading conditions (R=0.7 and R=0.1), information was extracted regarding the role of residual stress alone, and then, by subtracting this effect for the R=0.1 sample, for crack closure alone. To enable this analysis, we propose a introducing the concept of equivalent effective stress intensity factor range, ∆Keq,effproposed by Walker. Afterwards, the SIF range reduction ratio, $\beta$, which represents the “knock down” factor with respect to the steady state growth was assessed. It is in terms of these newly introduced parameters that the magnitude and extent of the overload-induced crack growth rate retardation can be plotted, fitted and decomposed into closure and residual stress effects, respectively. It is concluded that although the residual stress effect is present at all values of the load ratio R, its effect is relatively short-lived, whilst the closure effect that is dominant at low values of R causes longer range retardation.},

abstract = {The piping in some residual heat removal (RHR) systems in nuclear power plants, made of 304L stainless steel, is subjected to a multiaxial cyclic stress state in the cold/hot water mixing zone due to thermal fluctuations. In addition, residual stresses produced by welds and/or surface treatments can be large in magnitude and be tensile or compressive, depending on the proximity to the weld location. Crack networks have been observed to nucleate and grow under these stress states. Prominent cracks originating from micro-cracks on the order of grain size continue to grow to a length of about 2.5 mm. The thermal fluctuation is such that crack growth is in the high cycle fatigue regime. In this paper, the plane orientation and growth direction of these cracks with respect to the cyclic and mean stress states and their gradients are analyzed. The roles and interactions of shear, tensile, and compressive stresses with regards to the direction and orientation of the cracks are also discussed. Weld residual stresses (WRS) are decomposed into a local effect in tension near the weld and a structure effect in compression farther away, which also help explain some crack configurations in RHR systems. Moreover, a dependence of WRS field on spatial second derivative of weld temperature field is shown, which can have an important impact for comparison of measured and simulated WRS. Crack growth was also simulated with XFEM in the presence of WRS, with the principal hypothesis that mean stress acts only on crack opening.},

The failure load of the pre-cracked disks was measured, showing the decreasing effects of the cracks and their orientation on the final failure load. The breakage process of the disks was studied by inserting single and double cracks with different inclination angles. It was observed that wing cracks are produced at the first stage of loading, and start their propagation toward the direction of compressive line loading.

In this work the effect of the inherent scatter of strength as well as measurement uncertainties on the determination of n is analysed. Constant stress rate tests as proposed in the EN 843-3 standard are simulated using Monte Carlo techniques. It is shown that the large scatter of strength causes large uncertainties on the determination of n, yielding a significant influence of the sampling procedure especially for small samples.

@article{Pouget2008,
abstract = {In this work, results of a study conducted on fatigue crack propagation in friction stir welded AA2050 and the effects of FSW induced residual stresses, as well as changes in the microstructure, are presented. Longitudinal residual stress profiles across butt welded 2050 plates were determined using the cut compliance technique and fatigue crack growth testing was conducted on compact tension specimens machined from the friction stir welds. Tests were performed with the crack propagating nominally perpendicular to the weld and with a constant, applied, cyclic, stress intensity factor. Two different material tempers were investigated and in both cases residual stresses were found to have a major effect on the fatigue crack propagation. It was shown that compressive residual stresses are present in the vicinity of the weld, leading to crack closure and a decrease in the fatigue crack growth rate as the crack approaches the weld. Once in the weld nugget, the crack propagation rate increases. This increase is believed to be linked in part to tensile residual stresses but also to a microstructural effect present when the crack grows through the recrystallized nugget. It was also observed that other closure mechanisms, such as oxide-induced closure may affect the fatigue behavior of the 2050 FSW's. Two methods to predict fatigue crack growth rates in the weld zones were attempted: using the residual stress profiles determined by cut compliance and using the effective stress intensity factor, $\Delta$Keff, obtained during fatigue crack growth testing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This article reviews the technical literature on the determination of a residual stress profile by successive extension of a slot and measurement of the resulting strains or displacements. This technique is known variously in the literature as the crack compliance method, the successive cracking method, the slotting method, and a fracture mechanics based approach. The article briefly summarizes the chronological development of this method and then, to facilitate more detailed review, defines the components that make up the method. The theory section of the article first considers forward method solutions including fracture mechanics, finite element, analytical, and body force methods. Then it examines inverse solutions, including incremental inverses and series expansions. Next, the article reviews all experimental applications of the crack compliance method. Aspects reviewed include the specimen geometry and material, the details of making the slot, the deformation measurement, and the theoretical solutions used to solve for stress. Finally, the article makes a brief qualitative comparison between crack compliance and other residual stress measurement methods. In many situations, the crack compliance method offers several advantages over other methods: improved resolution of residual stress variation with depth; the ability to measure both small and very large parts; measurement of stress intensity factor caused by residual stress; measurement of crack closure stresses; increased sensitivity over other material removal methods; and the ability to measure non-crystalline materials.},

abstract = {The three-part paper deals with energy-minimal multiple crack propagation in a linear elastic solid under quasi-static conditions. The principle of minimum total energy, i.e. the sum of the potential and fracture energies, which stems directly from the Griffith's theory of cracks, is applied to the problem of arbitrary crack growth in 2D. The proposed formulation enables minimisation of the total energy of the mechanical system with respect to the crack extension directions and crack extension lengths to solve for the evolution of the mechanical system over time. The three parts focus, in turn, on (I) the theory of multiple crack growth including competing cracks, (II) the discrete solution by the extended finite element method using the minimum-energy formulation, and (III) the aspects of computer implementation within the Matlab programming language. The key contributions of Part-I of this three-part paper are given as follows. (1) Formulation of the total energy functional governing multiple crack behaviour. (2) Three solution methods to the problem of competing crack growth for different fracture front stabilities, e.g. stable, unstable, or partially stable crack tip configurations; we compare our approach to Budyn et al. (2004) and demonstrate via example cases that the latter approach of resolving competing crack growth is not energy minimal in some cases. Finally, (3), the minimum energy criterion for a set of crack tip extensions is posed as the condition of vanishing rotational dissipation rates with respect to the extension angles. The proposed formulation lends itself to a straightforward application within a discrete framework involving multiple finite-length crack tip extensions. The open-source Matlab code, documentation, benchmark/example cases are included as supplementary material.},

abstract = {Arc-length methods based on Newton–Raphson (NR) iterative numerical solvers are indispensable in non-linear mechanics to trace the equilibrium curves of systems with snap-back or snap-through behaviours. An example is a crack propagating in a rubber-like solid, which can generate extremely sharp snap-backs when the elastic energy is released. A standard arc-length solver satisfies the arc-length constraint which only limits the increment in displacements and in load level to a fixed amount. Thus, it cannot guarantee the satisfaction of the energy balance in the rate form. This work proposes an arc-length based on the J-integral, and assumes the Griffith balance as a constraint equation. Firstly, a fracture criterion (critical load and direction of crack increment) is formulated, consistent with the thermodynamic principle of maximum dissipation: a crack propagates in the direction of the maximum strain energy release rate. For this purpose, this paper provides an explicit and simple expression of the J-integral for varying angles. This fracture criterion does not require the computation of mixed mode Stress Intensity Factors, or asymptotic solutions or derivatives of the tangent stiffness matrix. By doing so, it is shown that the proposed method easily reconciles with the theory of Configurational Forces. Secondly, because of the explicit expression of J provided in this paper, it is easy to linearize the discretized equations of motions consistently. The method proves able to handle very sudden snap-backs occurring under large strains, and both brittle and ductile crack propagation. A particular example of such behaviour is kirigami (paper-cuts) structures made of graphene. The proposed arc-length can capture, for these structures, the transitions from brittle to ductile crack propagation for the same crack patterns, but different pre-crack lengths.},

abstract = {Significant internal oxidation was found in air plasma sprayed (APS) thermal barrier coating (TBC) samples with double-layered high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) NiCoCrAlY bond coats. The volumetric fraction of internal oxides within the bond coat increased from 5{\%} to 38{\%} during 799 h isothermal exposure at 1150 °C, indicating significant swelling of the internal oxides. This swelling behavior not only significantly increases the thickness of the bond coat layer from 175 $\mu$m to 260 $\mu$m, but also probably elevates the risk of interfacial failure in the TBCs, due to the roughness change at the interface and the huge residual stress generated. Thus, different finite element (FE) models were established to understand the role of the internal oxides in interfacial morphology and residual stress. The internal oxidation behavior was modeled on experimental results. The FE results showed that although the internal oxidation only slightly increased the interfacial roughness, significant changes were found in the patterns of the stress component S22 and the interfacial normal stress along the interface, increasing the risk of micro-cracks and changing the crack locations.},

The macrozone characteristics studied in this paper include the Schmid factors of grains within the macrozone, the misorientation between two macrozones or a macrozone and its adjacent area and the angle of the interface versus loading axis. In this study, fatigue crack was initiated within two adjacent macrozones or within a macrozone and its adjacent region with high Schmid factors. Misorientation crack factors are introduced to combine all the above influencing factors and crack initiation on the interface.

Crack-propagation behavior in the metallic glass was found to be similar to that observed in traditional ductile crystalline alloys (e.g., high-strength steels and aluminum alloys), both in terms the dependence of growth rates on the applied stress-intensity range and in the presence of ductile striations on fatigue fracture surfaces. Conversely, the stress-life behavior of the metallic glass (at R°0) was very different from that observed in the crystalline alloys. Fatigue lifetimes were much shorter in the amorphous alloy and exhibited a far lower dependence on the applied stress range; moreover, no evidence of a fatigue limit could be detected until stress amplitudes dropped below °1/25 of the tensile strength. Given the similarity in crack-growth behavior but the very different stress/life properties, the prime distinction in the cyclic fatigue behavior of ductile crystalline and bulk amorphous metals appears to be that the ease of crack initiation in the metallic glass is far less sensitive to the applied stress},

The current work was conducted as part of a larger America Makes funded project to begin to examine the effects of process variables on the microstructure and fracture and fatigue behavior of AM Ti-6Al-4V. In the fatigue crack growth tests, the fatigue threshold, Paris law slope, and overload toughness were determined at different load ratios, R, whereas fatigue precracked samples were tested to determine the fracture toughness. The as-deposited material exhibited a fine-scale basket-weave microstructure throughout the build, and although fracture surface examination revealed the presence of unmelted powders, disbonded regions, and isolated porosity, the resulting mechanical properties were in the range of those reported for cast and wrought Ti-6Al-4V.

abstract = {Fatigue crack propagation (FCG) experiments performed on a fully pearlitic steel subjected to severe plastic deformation are presented. The steel was deformed by high-pressure torsion to study the influence of applied strain and specimen orientation on the FCG-behavior. With increasing strain the lamellar structure of the steel is aligned parallel to the shear plane of the HPT-sample and the lamella spacing is markedly reduced. These microstructural changes exhibit a significant influence on the FCG-behavior. The threshold of stress intensity factor range decreases, while at the same time the fatigue crack propagation rate rises with increasing level of pre-deformation. In addition a pronounced anisotropy in the crack propagation behavior depending on the specimen orientation evolves. The observed trends will be explained on the basis of the fading influence of shielding mechanisms and the microstructural alignment of the structure upon deformation.},

The combined experimental and numerical research allowed a comparison between the stress-crack width ($\sigma$-w) relationship acquired straightforwardly from direct tensile tests, and the $\sigma$-w response derived from inverse analysis of the splitting tensile tests results. For this purpose a comprehensive nonlinear 3D finite element (FE) modeling strategy was developed. A comparison between the experimental results obtained from splitting tensile tests and the corresponding FE simulations confirmed the good accuracy of the proposed strategy to derive the $\sigma$-w law for these composites. It is concluded that the post-cracking tensile laws obtained from inverse analysis provided a close relationship with the ones obtained from the experimental uniaxial tensile tests.},

Synergistic effects of a mixture of both compatibilizers improve the FCP behavior and reveal the important role of interface stiffness and flexibility on the mechanical properties of polymer blends. The triblock terpolymer and JPs allow at the same time an elastic and stiff linkage at the blend interface and induce multiple deformation mechanisms such as crack bridging and matrix fibrillation that can dissipate energy and contribute to an improved FCP behavior. The presented concept allows tailoring macro-mechanical properties of immiscible polymer blends by adjusting blend morphology and interfacial properties.},

abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of assessment of fatigue crack growth (FCG) of 316LN stainless steel using the acoustic emission (AE) monitoring technique. A new AE parameter, i.e. AE entropy, was used for accurate assessment of fatigue damage and prediction of fatigue crack length. The effects of peak load on both FCG and AE behaviors were also discussed by fractographic observations and AE parameter analyses. The results showed that AE entropy is effective for accurately identifying the point of crack initiation and assessing the fatigue damage during FCG of 316LN stainless steel under high noise loading environment. Moreover, two distinct damage stages were distinguished by the characteristics of AE entropy. The source mechanisms of AE entropy for stage 1 were fatigue crack initiation and small crack growth, while the mechanisms responsible for stage 2 were the plastic activities in plastic zone at the crack tip, the formation of micro-voids and the ligaments shearing between these micro-voids. The results also indicated that AE entropy is available for identifying the transition in stress condition from plane strain to plane stress state of specimens under high peak load. In addition, a probabilistic model based on the quantitative relationship between the crack growth size and cumulated entropy was proposed for prognosis of crack growth. Bayesian inference was used to estimate the model parameters and the posterior predictive distribution of crack length. The predictive results showed that the model could accurately predict the measured crack growth lengths in all cases. The proposed model is applicable to stable long crack growth and can be applied under high noise loading environment.},

Although yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) ceramics have higher crack resistance than other dental ceramics, their aging susceptibility threatens their long-term performance in aqueous environments such as the oral cavity. Unfortunately, increasing the aging resistance of Y-TZP ceramics normally reduces their crack resistance. Our recently conducted systematic study of doping 3Y-TZP with various trivalent cations revealed that lanthanum oxide (La2O3) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have the most potent effect to retard the aging kinetics of 3Y-TZP. In this study, the crack-propagation behavior of La2O3 and Al2O3 co-doped 3Y-TZP ceramics was investigated by double-torsion methods.

The phantom node method is used to model the crack in the continuum region and a molecular statics model is used near the crack tip. To ensure self-consistency in the bulk, a virtual atom cluster is used to model the material of the coarse scale. The coupling between the coarse scale and fine scale is realized through ghost atoms. The ghost atom positions are interpolated from the coarse scale solution and enforced as boundary conditions on the fine scale. The fine scale region is adaptively enlarged as the crack propagates and the region behind the crack tip is adaptively coarsened. An energy criterion is used to detect the crack tip location. The triangular lattice in the fine scale region corresponds to the lattice structure of the (111) plane of an FCC crystal. The Lennard-Jones potential is used to model the atom-atom interactions. The method is implemented in two dimensions. The results are compared to pure atomistic simulations; they show excellent agreement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

It is advantageous to measure these residual stresses and the mode of stretching, which may be related to the failure characteristics of the bottle bases. Photoelasticity can be used to examine these residual stresses in the sidewalls and bases of bottles. This work reports on a residual stress measurement tool for the bottle blowing industry.},

The stress was monitored through strain gauges during the fatigue test, and the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip was determined by a two-strain-gage technique. The extended finite element method (XFEM) was adopted as a means of acquiring the stress in each specimen, or the SIF, where it is difficult to measure it during the fatigue test. The test results show significant improvement on the delay of crack propagation due to the ICR treatment, as well as the fatigue resistance within cracked areas. Moreover, the cracked section is enhanced when closing the crack surface through the comparison of the stress variation with, and without, crack closure. The SIF at the crack tip decreased by about 36{\%}, slowing down the crack growth rate, according to the fracture mechanics due to the change of crack profile and stress redistribution.},

Two specimen orientations, parallel and perpendicular to the deposition direction, have been evaluated at room temperature and at 250 °C. No difference in the fatigue crack growth rate could be confirmed for the two specimen orientations. However, in the fractographic study it was observed that the tortuosity varied between certain regions on the fracture surface. The local crack path characteristic could be related to the alpha colony size and/or the crystallographic orientation. Moreover, large areas exhibiting similar crystallographic orientation were observed along the prior beta grain boundaries, which were attributed to the wide alpha colonies frequently observed along the prior beta grain boundaries.},

For both the fracture toughness and crack growth evaluation, the compact tension specimen geometry was used. It was found that the fracture toughness was lower than what would be expected from wrought or cast product forms in the same alloy. This was attributed to the rapidly cooled, martensitic microstructure, developed in the parts. At low stress ratios, the crack growth rates were faster than in wrought titanium but became comparable at higher ratios. The fracture toughness appears to be higher when the crack is oriented perpendicular to the build layers. The difference in the average threshold and critical stress intensity values for the crack growth results for the three orientations was within the scatter of the data, so there was essentially no difference. The same was true for the empirically derived Paris Law constants. Residual stresses were likely to have overshadowed any variation in crack growth because of microstructural directionalities associated with build orientation.},

The solid is specified by its Young's modulus,E, Poisson's ratio, v, initial tensile yield stress, $\sigma$Y,and strain hardening exponent,N. The primary parameters specifying the traction-separation law of the fracture process are the work of separation per unit area, $\Gamma$0, and the peak traction, $\sigma${\&}{\#}x030C;gs. Highly refined calculations have been carried out for resistance curves, KR($\Delta$a), for plane strain, mode I growth in small-scale yielding as dependent on the parameters characterizing the elastic-plastic properties of the solid and its fracture process. With K0= [ E$\gamma$0(1 - v2)] 1 2 as the intensity needed to advance the crack in the absence of plasticity, KRK0is presented in terms of its dependence on the two most important parameters, $\sigma$ ̌ $\sigma$Yand N, with special emphasis on initiation toughness and steady-state toughness. Three applications of the results are made : to predict toughnesss when the fracture process is void growth and coalescence, to predict the role of plasticity on interface toughness for similar materials bonded together, and to illuminate the role of plasticity in enhancing toughness in dual-phase solids. The regime of applicability of the present model to ductile fracture due to void growth and coalescence, wherein multiple voids interact within the fracture process zone, is complementary to the regime of applicability of models describing the interaction between a single void and the crack tip. The two mechanism regimes are delineated and the consequence of a transition between them is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

In this study, deformation twinning, which is popular in the fatigue crack tip plastic zone of $\alpha$/$\beta$ titanium alloys with the Widmanstatten microstructure, was systematically investigated with the electron backscatter diffraction technique. With the propagation of the fatigue crack, large-scale twins were generated due to the periodic loading and the crystallographic feature of the Widmanstatten microstructure, and they ultimately consumed the major volume of the parent $\alpha$ colony. Twin development with various ranks of Schmid factors (SF) was characterized, while ordinary deformation twins with relatively high rank SF grew most, extraordinary twins with very low rank SF were also activated, although restricted by the ordinary twins. The occurrence of extraordinary twins (including primary and secondary twins) was mainly attributed to the non-uniform local stress distribution induced by the plastic deformation compatibility between the neighboring units. Lastly, the influence of deformation twinning on the mechanical properties concerning crack propagation in hexagonal $\alpha$-Ti alloys was discussed.},
