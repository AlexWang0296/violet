abstract = {The tensile behavior of monocrystalline nickel with nano-void was studied via molecular dynamics simulation (MD) considering different lattice orientations. A series of simulations were performed to analyze the effect of system size, void volume fraction and lattice orientation on mechanical properties and microstructure evolution. The influence of size of sample on the incipient yield stress is discussed. The results show that void volume fractions have significant effects on Young's modulus, incipient yield stress and incipient yield strain. Dislocation structure begins to nucleate in the stress concentration area. The critical stress of [1 0 0], [1 1 0] and [1 1 1] orientation is 6.97 GPa, 6.77 GPa and 7.31 GPa, respectively. The results of dislocation propagation and stress-strain responses reveal the elastic-plastic properties of different orientations. The fracture strain is the elongation of the specimen. The elongation of the sample along [1 1 1] orientation is greatest, which illustrate that the sample has good ductility performance along [1 1 1] orientation in the same initial damage. The reaction between the dislocations and the boundary leads to the rearrangement of the boundary atoms, which proves that the dislocation can not be stopped inside the crystal, or closed or terminated at the crystal surface or grain boundary. The difference of the rearrangement of the boundary atoms is due to the difference of the sliding systems of different orientations.},

abstract = {The effects of compressive residual stress on short fatigue crack growth in Inconel 718 have been investigated. Using two different indentation procedures, controlled plane-strain compressive residual stress fields were applied to short through-thickness cracks, which had been generated by machining away wakes of long cracks that had been grown down to threshold levels at a stress ratio of 0.1. Short fatigue crack growth tests were conducted at stress ratios of 0.1 and 0.7. At a stress ratio of 0.1, the residual stress-free testpieces demonstrated typical short fatigue crack growth behaviour, indicated by a reduction of threshold value and increases in fatigue crack growth rates compared to those of long fatigue cracks. A significant decrease in short crack growth rates was observed within the compressive residual stress region of indented testpieces, together with an increase of threshold values. At a high stress ratio of 0.7, any similar decrease in rate is barely observable. This indicates that the effects of compressive residual stress on short fatigue crack growth are monotonic in sign and could perhaps be simulated by a crack closure approach similar to that applied for long fatigue cracks. However the superposition principle which incorporates the compressive residual stress as a negative stress intensity factor, despite many successful applications to long fatigue cracks, is found to be inappropriate here. Hence one should be cautious when extending such a methodology to short fatigue cracks as it may result in optimistic life estimations.},

@article{Bitzek2013,
abstract = {Whether a stressed material fractures by brittle cleavage or ductile rupture is determined by its ability to convert elastic strain energy to plastic deformation through the generation and motion of dislocations. Although it is known that pre-existing dislocations play a crucial role in crack tip plasticity, the involved mechanisms are unclear. Here it is demonstrated by atomistic simulations that individual pre-existing dislocations may lead to the generation of large numbers of dislocations at the crack tip. The newly generated dislocations are usually of different types. The processes involved are fundamentally different for stationary cracks and propagating cracks. Whereas local crack front reorientation plays an important role in propagating cracks, the multiplication mechanism at stationary cracks is connected with cross-slip in the highly inhomogeneous stress field of the crack. Analysis of the forces acting on the dislocations allows to determine which dislocations multiply and the slip systems they activate. These results provide the necessary physical link between pre-existing dislocations and the generation of dislocations at crack tips. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.
