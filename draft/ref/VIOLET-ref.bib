abstract = {The deformation mechanisms active in the $\gamma$- and $\alpha$ 2 -lamellae of a Ti-48 at.{\%}Al alloy during room-temperature and 800 C tensile loading have been determined by transmission electron microscopy. A marked change in the plastic behaviour of the $\alpha$ 2 -phase has been detected between room and elevated temperature, whereas the deformation mechanisms active in the $\gamma$-phase remained the same at both temperatures. At room temperature, plasticity in the $\alpha$ 2 -phase occurred only locally by prism plane slip of dislocations with Burgers vectors parallel to 〈1120〉 where cross-lamellar twins in the $\gamma$-plane impinged on the ($\gamma$/$\alpha$ 2 )-interface. At 800′C more homogeneous plastic behaviour of the $\alpha$ 2 -phase resulted from slip and climb activity of dislocations. with Burgers vector components parallel to〈1120〉and parallel to both 〈1120〉 and [0001] The increased contribution to strain accommodation at 800′C by the $\alpha$ 2 -lamellae coincided with a change in predominant fracture mode. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

abstract = {Intermetallic titanium aluminides are often alloyed with niobium to improve oxidation resistance and mechanical properties. Depending on the overall alloy composition and on the solubility of the present phases for niobium, new phases may be introduced in the alloys' microstructure upon niobium addition. Here we describe the microstructure of the alloy Ti-42Al-8.5Nb produced by powder metallurgy after annealing at 550 °C and 650 °C. We identify the orthorhombic O-phase within $\alpha$2 laths of lamellar ($\alpha$2 + $\gamma$) colonies by single crystal electron diffraction and high-resolution imaging. Domains of O-phase variants and $\alpha$2 phase form columnar crystallites in $\alpha$2 (0001) planes having low indexed $\alpha$2 {\{}11-20{\}} and {\{}1-100{\}} interface planes. The nm-sized domains are rotated with respect to each other resulting in elastic strains across the domain boundaries. No elemental segregation of Nb was detected in $\alpha$2/O-phase lamellae.},

@article{void.creep,
abstract = {An investigation on the effect of aging on the tensile properties and creep behavior of a fully lamellar (FL) Ti-47Al-2Nb-1Mn-0.5W-0.5Mo-0.2Si (at.{\%}) alloy is presented. Aging at intermediate temperatures produces precipitate particles predominantly along $\alpha$2/$\gamma$ lamellar interfaces or within $\alpha$2lamellae. Most of the precipitates are $\beta$-particles with fewer silicides. Aging at intermediate temperatures leads to increased tensile strength as a result of precipitation of $\beta$ and silicide particles. In addition, aging yields an increased primary creep resistance but a shortened creep life for the FL structure. The shortened creep life of the aged FL structures could be a result of early decomposition of $\alpha$2lamellae during creep. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kim1991,
abstract = {During the last two years remarkable improvements have been made in the properties (such as toughness and creep) and processing technology of gamma titanium aluminides, making them potentially viable engineering alloys for high-temperature structural applications. These achievements were made possible by a greater understanding of both the fundamental and the practical aspects of these aluminides, such as phase relationships, the effects of alloying elements, deformation mechanisms, microstructure evolution and processing. This article reviews the current understanding of the above specific aspects and the processing-microstructure-property relationships, and identifies pacing problems and applications.},

@article{Xiong2015,
abstract = {Dislocation interactions with distributed condensed vacancy clusters in fcc metals were simulated via a concurrent atomistic-continuum method. Due to void strengthening, the dislocation lines are found to bow as a result of pinning on the original glide plane and undergo depinning through drawing out screw dipoles and forming prismatic loops on the secondary slip plane. We discovered an inertia-induced transition between Hirsch looping and void shearing mechanisms as the void spacing ranges from the scale of nm to hundreds of nm. Contrary to prior understanding, simulations suggest that large voids (∼5 nm in diameter) can behave as weak barriers to dislocation motions under high strain-rate dynamic conditions.},
