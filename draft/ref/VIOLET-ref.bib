abstract = {Long-range internal back stresses developed during room temperature tensile deformation of titanium aluminide alloys have been determined. Dip tests were implemented during the strain-controlled tensile deformation and the resulting sample deformation was monitored in the relaxation regime of the machine. The internal stress was determined as the critical stress at which the inelastic sample relaxation is reversed, i.e. going from the tensile direction to the compression direction. The investigation involves a wide range of alloy compositions with a corresponding variation in the strength properties. For the alloys investigated, the internal stress is about 80{\%} of the yield stress. The mechanical tests were coupled with electron microscopy examination of the defect structure in order to assess the strain accommodation occurring during deformation. Possible sources for the built up internal stresses are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Intermetallic titanium aluminides are often alloyed with niobium to improve oxidation resistance and mechanical properties. Depending on the overall alloy composition and on the solubility of the present phases for niobium, new phases may be introduced in the alloys' microstructure upon niobium addition. Here we describe the microstructure of the alloy Ti-42Al-8.5Nb produced by powder metallurgy after annealing at 550 °C and 650 °C. We identify the orthorhombic O-phase within $\alpha$2 laths of lamellar ($\alpha$2 + $\gamma$) colonies by single crystal electron diffraction and high-resolution imaging. Domains of O-phase variants and $\alpha$2 phase form columnar crystallites in $\alpha$2 (0001) planes having low indexed $\alpha$2 {\{}11-20{\}} and {\{}1-100{\}} interface planes. The nm-sized domains are rotated with respect to each other resulting in elastic strains across the domain boundaries. No elemental segregation of Nb was detected in $\alpha$2/O-phase lamellae.},

abstract = {The growth and coalescence of voids in magnesium single crystals at the nanoscale have been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and the embedded atom method. One void and two void specimens with identical initial void volume fractions were utilized to study the mechanism of void growth and coalescence. In order to study the influences of material length scale on void evolution in single crystals four specimen sizes with the same initial volume fraction of voids were considered. Investigations of the effects of temperature and strain rate were also performed. Uniaxial stress-strain curves were monitored during increasing employed strain. The simulation results show that the specimen size, loading strain rate and temperature had apparent influences on the twin or dislocation pattern, void evolution shape and uniaxial stress-strain responses, but negligible effects on the initial slopes of the uniaxial stress-strain curves. Furthermore, the nucleation stress of twin bands in orientation A - x[0 0 0 1]-y[1 over(2, ̄) 1 0]-z[1 0 over(1, ̄) 0] was much higher than that of plastic deformation in orientation B - x[1 over(2, ̄) 1 0]-y[1 0 over(1, ̄) 0]-z[0 0 0 1].},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently - those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers - the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The atomic structures of the 3//a2 and 3//3/T interfaces in a TiAI alloy were investigated using conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to understand the growth mechanisms and deformation behavior of the two-phase alloy. The results show that the a2 plates grow from the 3/phase by the migration of a/6(112) partial dislocation ledges across the faces and that the 3//ct2 interface usually contains closely spaced arrays of interfacial dislocations. Deformation twins cut through both 3/twin boundaries and a2 plates during de-formation, although slip of twinning dislocations through ce2 appears to be a difficult process. Both the 3//ct2 and 3//3/T interfaces can be imaged and modeled at the atomic level, although slight crystal and/or beam tilt can complicate image interpretation.},

A marked change in the plastic behaviour of the $\alpha$ 2 -phase has been detected between room and elevated temperature, whereas the deformation mechanisms active in the $\gamma$-phase remained the same at both temperatures. At room temperature, plasticity in the $\alpha$ 2 -phase occurred only locally by prism plane slip of dislocations with Burgers vectors parallel to 〈1120〉 where cross-lamellar twins in the $\gamma$-plane impinged on the ($\gamma$/$\alpha$ 2 )-interface.

abstract = {Successful scientific applications of large-scale molecular dynamics often rely on automated methods for identifying the local crystalline structure of condensed phases. Many existing methods for structural identification, such as Common Neighbour Analysis, rely on interatomic distances (or thresholds thereof) to classify atomic structure. As a consequence they are sensitive to strain and thermal displacements, and preprocessing such as quenching or temporal averaging of the atomic positions is necessary to provide reliable identifications. We propose a new method, Polyhedral Template Matching (PTM), which classifies structures according to the topology of the local atomic environment, without any ambiguity in the classification, and with greater reliability than e.g. Common Neighbour Analysis in the presence of thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that the method can reliably be used to identify structures even in simulations near the melting point, and that it can identify the most common ordered alloy structures as well. In addition, the method makes it easy to identify the local lattice orientation in polycrystalline samples, and to calculate the local strain tensor. An implementation is made available under a Free and Open Source Software license.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is used to simulate the crack propagation along the interface of Ti6Al4V/TiC in Titanium metal matrix composites under Mode-I and II loadings and at different temperatures. MD simulation can then determine the interfacial traction-separation relationship between Ti6Al4V and TiC. The interatomic potential between the atoms in Ti6Al4V/TiC composite is defined by the second-nearest neighborhood modified embedded atom method (2NN MEAM) and the Morse potential. For Vanadium-Carbon (V-C) interatomic potential, the 2NN MEAM parameters are developed and validated based on previous first principle calculations conducted on VC structure. MD simulation results show asymmetrical crack propagation along the interface between Ti6Al4V/TiC and the crack propagates in Ti6Al4V than along the interface. The obtained traction-separation relationship is used to parametrize the cohesive zone model (CZM) for modeling the interface in finite element analysis. Validation of the parameterized relationship is done by finite element simulation of the compression test of Ti6Al4V/TiC at different volume fractions of TiC. A good agreement is shown between the stress-strain results obtained from simulation and the experimental data under the same conditions.},

abstract = {The evolution, growth and coalescence, of nanovoids play a significant role in the plasticity of nanocrystalline metallic materials. Previous atomistic studies of void growth in face centered copper, and other metallic materials, have considered voids in single crystals, and those located at grain boundaries in polycrystals. The evolution of a spherical nanovoid in copper polycrystals under uniaxial tension is the focus of this atomistic investigation. In this paper, a critical stress based criterion is proposed for emission of dislocations from spherical void surfaces. The preference of dislocation source, GBs or spherical void surfaces, is determined by the relative magnitude of the critical stresses to emit dislocations from GBs or spherical void surfaces. The criterion reveals that there exists a grain size dependent critical void diameter at which the dislocation emission transits from GBs to spherical void surfaces as the spherical void grows. Simulation results show that, in intragranular voided models, the critical void diameter is 13 nm for simulation models with a 16.32 nm grain size and is 5.5 nm for simulation models with a 6.92 nm grain size. The critical void diameters revealed by simulations are in agreement with that obtained by the criterion. In addition, the simulation results indicate that the Gurson's model may be extended to predict the global yield conditions for simulation models with intragranular spherical voids. In the simulation models with intergranular voids, the spherical void continuously grows due to the initial dislocation emission from the intersections of GBs and spherical void surfaces.},

They only emit light at the free exciton (1.491 eV) and the donor bound exciton transition (1.4855 eV). The ZB NWs exhibit a photoluminescence spectrum being unaffected by the twinning planes. Surprisingly, the acceptor-related emission in the ZB NWs can be almost completely removed by etching away the impurity-contaminated sidewall grown via a vapor-solid mechanism.},

Roller indentations impressed parallel to the crack plane significantly improve the fracture toughness. The residual strains present in the indentation zone were characterized by X-ray diffraction and modelled using finite element (FE) calculations. The experimentally observed macrostrains exhibit remarkable crystallographic anisotropies and are unequally shared between the major alloy constituents. The mechanisms behind the observed toughening have been discussed in terms of the residual strains and factors improving the crack tip plasticity. With regard to intended high-temperature applications, the temperature retention of the toughening effect was studied.},

For optimization of mechanical properties such as yield and creep strengths, tensile ductility and fracture resistance, a basic understanding of the temperature dependent micromechanisms of plasticity and fracture, and their interplay with various microstructural constituents is required. In this review article, the current knowledge on dislocation types and slip systems, the development of deformation substructures, factors controlling the mobility and multiplication of dislocations, interface related plasticity, solid solution and precipitate strengthening mechanisms as well as microscopic aspects of creep and fracture will be addressed.

Due to void strengthening, the dislocation lines are found to bow as a result of pinning on the original glide plane and undergo depinning through drawing out screw dipoles and forming prismatic loops on the secondary slip plane. We discovered an inertia-induced transition between Hirsch looping and void shearing mechanisms as the void spacing ranges from the scale of nm to hundreds of nm. Contrary to prior understanding, simulations suggest that large voids (∼5 nm in diameter) can behave as weak barriers to dislocation motions under high strain-rate dynamic conditions.},

Ferritic-pearlitic steel pipes are welded with two passes, resulting in a characteristic residual stress state with high tensile residual stresses at the weld root. Four-point bending is applied to generate axial load stress causing changes in the residual stress state. These are determined both on the outer and inner surfaces of the pipes, as well as in the pipe wall, using X-ray and neutron diffraction. Focusing on the effect of tensile load stress, it is revealed that not only the tensile residual stresses are reduced due to exceeding the yield stress, but also the compressive residual stresses for equilibrium reasons. Furthermore, residual stress relaxation occurs both parallel and perpendicular to the applied load stress.},

Aging at intermediate temperatures produces precipitate particles predominantly along $\alpha$2/$\gamma$ lamellar interfaces or within $\alpha$2lamellae. Most of the precipitates are $\beta$-particles with fewer silicides. Aging at intermediate temperatures leads to increased tensile strength as a result of precipitation of $\beta$ and silicide particles. In addition, aging yields an increased primary creep resistance but a shortened creep life for the FL structure. The shortened creep life of the aged FL structures could be a result of early decomposition of $\alpha$2lamellae during creep. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to study the shrinkage of spherical nano-void under uniaxial compression load in $\gamma$-TiAl single crystal. During the compression, the nano-void crystal undergoes elastic then plastic deformation process. In the elastic period, the nano-void shrinks linearly along compression direction while it expands linearly along the directions perpendicular to the compression direction. Finally, the nano-void collapses from all directions at the beginning of the plastic process. The formation and extension of dislocations and the shrinking mechanism of void were analyzed in detail. The dependence of the void shrinking on the specimen size, strain rate, and void volume fraction were also investigated. It is found that the stacking faults' slipping in the crystal during plastic period is the main deformation mechanism of the void shrinkage: dislocation structures initially start to nucleate around the equator area of the void, then partial dislocations and planar faults constantly propagate, finally the stacking faults and partial dislocations swap through the entire system and the void shrinks.},

The change in microhardness was found to occur in two stages regardless of the amount of reduction; the first stage associated with the decrease in dislocation density and the second stage related with the annealing-out of deformation twins introduced in TiAl lamallae during rolling. However, the recrystallization mode was found to vary depending on the amount of reduction in thickness. In specimens rolled to less than 20{\%} reduction in thickness, the full recovery in hardness occurs preserving the lamellar structure. In contrast, in specimens rolled to more than 40{\%}, a structure composed of equiaxed grains of TiAl is obtained after recrystallization. A mechanism is proposed to interpret the unusual recrystallization behavior of PST crystals of TiAl cold-rolled to less than 20{\%}. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

A second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method interatomic potential for the binary nickel-titanium system is determined by improving the unary descriptions of pure nickel and pure titanium, especially regarding the physical properties at finite temperatures. The resulting potential reproduces accurately the hexagonal-close-packed to body-centered-cubic phase transition in Ti and the martensitic B2-B19 transformation in equiatomic NiTi. Subsequent large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations validate that the developed potential can be successfully applied for studies on temperature-and stress-induced martensitic phase transitions related to core applications of shape-memory alloys. A simulation of the temperature-induced phase transition provides insights into the effect of sizes and constraints on the formation of nanotwinned martensite structures with multiple domains. A simulation of the stress-induced phase transition of a nanosized pillar indicates a full recovery of the initial structure after the loading and unloading processes, illustrating a superelastic behavior of the target system.},

abstract = {Intermetallic titanium aluminide alloys based on the ordered face-centred tetragonal $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase represent a good example how fundamental and applied research along with industrial development can lead to a new and innovative class of advanced engineering materials. After almost three decades of intensive R{\&}D activities $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys have matured from "laboratory curiosities" to novel structural light-weight materials which eventually found their applications in aerospace and automotive industries. Their advantage is mainly seen in low density (3.9-4.2 g/cm3), high specific yield strength and stiffness, good oxidation and ignition resistance, combined with good creep properties up to high temperatures. Particularly at temperatures between 600 °C and 800 °C $\gamma$(TiAl)-based alloys are superior to Ti-based alloys in terms of their specific strength. Compared to the heavier Ni-based alloys below 800 °C, their specific yield strength is at least similar. Therefore, the particular constitution and extremely fine microstructure of these alloys are illustrated by several high-resolution transmission electron micrographs. The mechanical properties seem to be largely affected by the evolution of internal stresses and off-stoichiometric deviations of the majority $\gamma$(TiAl)-phase. Novel experimental approaches are described that could characterize the relevant deformation mechanisms. The combination of these results with the concepts of continuum mechanics and continuum thermodynamics has allowed developing models to describe thermomechanically controlled processes. A selection of such models is introduced and explained in a comprehensive way. While early modeling attempts were successfully undertaken to elucidate selected aspects of physical metallurgy of Ti-Al alloys, many experimental findings, particularly for modern multi-phase alloys based on $\gamma$(TiAl) with rather complex constitution and microstructure are still waiting for explanation.},

abstract = {Semiempirical interatomic potentials have been developed for Al, $\alpha$−Ti, and $\gamma$−TiAl within the embedded atom method (EAM) formalism by fitting to a large database of experimental as well as ab initio data. The ab initio calculations were performed by the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method within the density functional theory to obtain the equations of state for a number of crystal structures of the Ti-Al system. Some of the calculated LAPW energies were used for fitting the potentials while others for examining their quality. The potentials correctly predict the equilibrium crystal structures of the phases and accurately reproduce their basic lattice properties. The potentials are applied to calculate the energies of point defects, surfaces, and planar faults in the equilibrium structures. Unlike earlier EAM potentials for the Ti-Al system, the proposed potentials provide a reasonable description of the lattice thermal expansion, demonstrating their usefulness for molecular-dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations at high temperatures. The energy along the tetragonal deformation path (Bain transformation) in $\gamma$−TiAl calculated with the EAM potential is in fairly good agreement with LAPW calculations. Equilibrium point defect concentrations in $\gamma$−TiAl are studied using the EAM potential. It is found that antisite defects strongly dominate over vacancies at all compositions around stoichiometry, indicating that $\gamma$−TiAl is an antisite disorder compound, in agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {Abstract Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to study the shrinkage of spherical nano-void under uniaxial compression load in $\gamma$-TiAl single crystal. During the compression, the nano-void crystal undergoes elastic then plastic deformation process. In the elastic period, the nano-void shrinks linearly along compression direction while it expands linearly along the directions perpendicular to the compression direction. Finally, the nano-void collapses from all directions at the beginning of the plastic process. The formation and extension of dislocations and the shrinking mechanism of void were analyzed in detail. The dependence of the void shrinking on the specimen size, strain rate, and void volume fraction were also investigated. It is found that the stacking faults' slipping in the crystal during plastic period is the main deformation mechanism of the void shrinkage: dislocation structures initially start to nucleate around the equator area of the void, then partial dislocations and planar faults constantly propagate, finally the stacking faults and partial dislocations swap through the entire system and the void shrinks.},

abstract = {Hot deformation behavior of high Nb containing TiAl based alloy with a nominal composition of Ti-44Al-8Nb-0.2W-0.2B-0.1Y at 1225 °C and 1275 °C is investigated. The deformation mechanism of $\alpha$ phase is dynamic recovery at 1275 °C, whereas $\gamma$ phase is mainly dynamic recrystallized. It is revealed that $\alpha$ phase is softer and easier to be deformed when the alloy is deformed at 1275 °C. The reasons of the different deformation behavior between 1225 °C and 1275. °C, as well as the different deformation behavior between $\alpha$ phase and $\gamma$ phase are analyzed. A multistep deformation process at gradually lowered temperature is proposed to eliminate the adverse influence of remnant lamellar structure on mechanical properties.},
