The findings from moleculary simulation can be concluded as follows:
1.  Deformation mechanism:
Bulk model without void exhibits typical deformation mechanism of two-phase alloy 
    1.1 alpha phase
    1.2 gamma phase

[gamma phase]The configure of atoms is shown in Fig.\ref{}, it can be seen that dislication emission initiate in \gamma pahse in XXX ps, and the deformation canbe mainly confied to the majority \gamma pahse. \gamma(TiAl) deforms by octahedral glide of ordinary dislocations with the Burgers vector b = 1/2<110] and superdislocations with the Burgers vectors b=<101] and b=1/2<11\bar{2}]. The other potential deformation mode is mechanical twinning along 1/6<11\overline{2}]{111}.

From Fig.\ref{}, of the two constituents of (\alpha_2+\gamma) alloys, the \alpha_2 phase is more difficult to deform. A reason for the unequal strain partitioning between the \alpha_2 and \gamma phase is certainly the strong plastic anisotropy of the \alpha_2 phase. TEM examinations performed on tensile  tested lamellar alloys have revealed that the limited plasticity of the \alpha_2 phase is mainly carried by local slip of <a>-type dislocations with the Burgers vector b=1/3<11\overline{2}0> prism planes\ref{}, which is by far the easiest slip system in \alpha_2 single crystals.

There is good consensus that the deformation is mainly confined to the majority γ (TiAl) phase, regardless of whether the alloy has a lamellar or equiaxed microstructure [32, 33, 75, 119 – 122] .
As has been described in Section 5.1 , γ (TiAl) deforms by octahedral glide of ordinary dislocations with the Burgers vector b = 1/2 < 110] and superdislocations with the Burgers vectors b = < 101] and b=<1 2 112/], respectively. 

. The extent to which any of these deformation modes contributes to the total strain is the subject of ongoing discussion and seems to depend on alloy composition. Most investiga- tions have shown that in the γ phase of two - phase alloys, glide of ordinary disloca- tions is the primary deformation mode, followed by mechanical twinning [32, 33, 75, 119 – 125] . This twinning activity is remarkably different from the deformation of single - phase γ alloys, which show a general reluctance to twin. As an example, Figure 6.32 shows the deformation structure that has been observed after room - temperature compression to a strain of ε = 3%, involving ordinary dislocations and mechanical twins. Most, if not all, of the ordinary dislocations are lying near the screw orientation, whereas the superdislocations mostly have a mixed charac- ter. This observation indicates that the mobility of the ordinary dislocations depends on their character, a fact that will be discussed in a later section. Estima- tions of dislocation densities in such samples with the help of the line intersection method [126] typically yield dislocation densities of 10 8
cm − 2 to 10 9 cm − 2 . Trace
analysis and stereographic imaging have revealed that the ordinary dislocations mostly glide on oblique {111} planes [33, 75] ; thus outside certain orientations, multiple slip of ordinary dislocations is the rule rather than the exception. As will be shown in a later section, multiple slip is probably an important mechanism contributing to work hardening. There are plenty of published micrographs showing evenly distributed ordinary screw dislocations, but as demonstrated in Figure 6.32 , there are also specifi c instances of piled - up dislocations.

From Fig.\ref{}, of the two constituents of (\alpha_2+\gamma) alloys, the \alpha_2 phase is more difficult to deform.

Another reason for the unequal strain partitioning between the \alpha_2 and \gamma phase is certainly the strong plastic anisotropy of the \alpha_2
phase. TEM examinations performed on tensile  tested lamellar alloys have revealed that the limited plasticity of the \alpha_2 phase is mainly carried by local slip of <a>-type dislocations with the Burgers vector b=1/3<11\overline{2}0> prism planes\ref{}, which is by far the easiest slip system in \alpha_2 single crystals. To a lesser extent, glide of 1 3 1120 / <> dislocations was observed on {}2201 pyramidal planes, that is, on π 1 pyramidal planes of the first order [135].
