abstract = "In this chapter, the following issues for fracture of TiAl alloys are elucidated: microcracking composed of nucleation and propagation processes; driving force and resistance; mechanisms of global fracture, clarified as critical crack-triggered fracture and damage accumulation-induced fracture; the main kinds of toughening micromechanisms; the effects of microscopic damage on the global fracture presenting in the volumetric effects and the facial effects; the effects of loading rate on the microcrack damage; and the fracture mechanisms of compression specimens. Finally, micromechanisms of brittle fracture of the shape memory alloy NiTi is discussed and set forth."
