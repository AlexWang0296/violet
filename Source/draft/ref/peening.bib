abstract = {Laser shock peening can improve the damage tolerance of metallic materials by introducing deep compressive residual stress that inhibits crack initiation and growth. This study investigates the laser peening of aluminium alloy in a product form – an extruded T-section – that has different crystallographic textures in different locations. The alloy studied is Al 2099, an aluminium-lithium alloy that shows anisotropy in the mechanical properties when texture is present. Specimens extracted from different regions of the extrusion were laser shock peened with a power density of 3 GW/cm2in single shocks as well as in a pattern. Residual stresses were characterized primarily using incremental hole drilling. The results show 20{\%} higher residual stresses in the web area of the extrusion compared to the flange after peening with a single laser shock, with this difference decreasing as the number of shocks increases. This effect can be explained by the difference in yield strength between those locations. No significant differences were observed in the residual stresses from peening onto different planes of a textured sample at a given location.},

abstract = {In this study, the residual stress relaxation behaviour occurring during low-cycle fatigue in shot-peened specimens with either a flat or a notched geometry has been studied. A representative low-pressure steam turbine material, FV448, was used. The residual stress and strain hardening profiles caused by shot peening were measured experimentally and were then incorporated into a finite element model. By allowing for both effects of shot peening, the residual stress relaxation behaviour was successfully simulated using this model and correlated well with the experimental data. Although more modelling work may be required to simulate the interaction between shot peening effects and external loads in a range of notched geometries, the model predictions are consistent with the specimens tested in the current study. The novelty of this study lies in the development of such a modelling approach which can be used to effectively simulate the complex interaction between shot peening effects and external loads in notched regions. Compared with the un-notched geometry, the notched geometry was found to be more effective in retaining the improvement in fatigue life resulting from shot peening, by restricting the compressive residual stress relaxation during fatigue loading.

The asymmetric and broadened diffraction profiles registered at each location were analyzed by sub-profiling and explained in terms of the heterogeneous dislocation cell structure. For the first time, the spatial distribution of residual stress induced in micro-scale laser shock peening was experimentally quantified and compared with the simulation result obtained from FEM analysis.

abstract = {Machining processes are known to drastically impact the performance and lifetime of a component subjected to fatigue in service. Therefore, understanding the effect of manufacturing processes on surface integrity is vital to determine their suitability for any given application. As part of a wider study investigating multiple production operations, results are presented here which characterise the fatigue performance and failure mechanisms of Ti-6Al-4V specimens subject to conventional (end milling, surface grinding) and non-conventional machining processes (abrasive waterjet machining, wire electrical discharge machining, large area electron beam melting). Post process shot peening was then applied on each of the 5 different surfaces generated and the resulting fatigue response similarly evaluated. The abrasive waterjet machined specimens generally exhibited the longest fatigue life, particularly at higher applied stress (≥ 700 MPa) irrespective of surface condition. Despite the difference in process mechanisms, fatigue results for the milled and wire electrical discharge machined surfaces were comparable. Examination of the fatigue specimen fracture surfaces however, revealed that the locations of crack initiation were inconsistent for the different processes and conditions assessed. In general, post process shot peening increased the fatigue strength/life of all the evaluated specimens, regardless of the base machining operation.},

abstract = {Foreign object damage (FOD) can seriously shorten the fatigue lives of components. On the other hand, laser shock peening improves fatigue life by introducing deep compressive residual stress into components. In this paper we examine how the non-uniform steep residual stress profile arising from FOD of laser peened aerofoil leading edges varies as a function of fatigue crack growth under high cycle fatigue and mixed high and low cycle fatigue conditions. The ballistic FOD impacts were introduced by impacting a cube edge head-on (at an angle of 0°) to the leading edge. The residual stress distributions have been mapped by synchrotron X-ray diffraction prior to cracking and subsequent to short (∼1 mm) and long (up to 6 mm) crack growth. The results suggest that the local residual stress field is highly stable even to the growth of relatively long cracks.},

X-ray diffraction line profile analysis (XRDLPA) was used to identify variation of micro-structure and residual stress relaxation behaviors on the top surface of 18CrNiMo7-6 steel after SP during isothermal annealing. The results show that the micro-strain, dislocation density, stored energy, compressive residual stress (CRS) and micro-hardness on the top surface of 18CrNiMo7-6 steel after SP decrease with the increase of annealing time. But the domain size increases with increasing annealing time at four different temperatures.

abstract = {Numerical modelling of the residual stresses and strains within mechanical components is of great importance for improving the quality and reliability of design for structural integrity. A particularly versatile and powerful approach is offered by direct and inverse eigenstrain modelling. The nature of the eigenstrain modelling approach is that it not only generates an efficient parametric representation of the residual stress field, but also ensures consistency by enforcing stress equilibrium and strain compatibility. In the present study we propose a particular way of prescribing the eigenstrain field due to surface treatment such as shot peening. Eigenstrain variation is described by a continuous function of the distance from the boundary of the object in a two-dimensional model of its cross-section. The procedure is compatible with the use of commercial numerical simulation software, and allows correct assignment of all eigenstrain components. We apply the technique to the evaluation of residual strain within an additively manufactured nickel superalloy compressor blade that was subsequently subjected to shot peening treatment. Two experimental techniques are used to validate the model, namely, Focused Ion Beam ring core milling (FIB-DIC) and synchrotron X-ray Powder Diffraction (SXRPD). Consistency between model prediction and experimental measurements provides verification of the suitability of eigenstrain modelling as consistent basis for the incorporation of residual stress effects on the deformation behaviour of manufactured components.},

abstract = {Foreign object damage (FOD) has been identified as one of the primary life limiting factors for fan and compressor blades, with the leading edge of aerofoils particularly susceptible to such damage.In this study, a generic aerofoil specimen of Ti-6Al-4V alloy was used. The specimens were treated by laser shock peening (LSP) to generate compressive residual stresses in the leading edge region prior to impact. FOD was simulated by firing a cubical projectile at the leading edge using a laboratory gas gun at 200. m/s, head-on; and at 250. m/s, at an angle of 45°. The specimens were then subjected to 4-point bend fatigue testing under high cycle (HCF), low cycle (LCF) and combined LCF and HCF loading conditions.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterise the damage features due to FOD. Crack initiation and early crack growth due to FOD and subsequent fatigue growth were examined in detail. The results were compared between the two impact conditions; and with those from samples without LSP treatment as well as those impacted with spherical projectiles. The results seem to suggest that LSP has improved the crack growth resistance post FOD. Delayed onset of crack initiation was observed in LSPed samples compared to those without LSP under similar loading conditions. Damage features depend on the geometry of the projectile, the impact angle as well as the impact velocity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

However, in the dynamic impact test, tensile residual stress was created near the center of the ball indentation mark and compression residual stress was created outside of the indentation. Furthermore, the tensile residual stress in the center of the first ball indentation mark changed to compressive stress as the density of the ball indentations surrounding the first ball indentation mark increased.

abstract = {A method combining experiment and simulation was used in this paper to study the effects of warm laser peening (WLP) on the residual stress relaxation (RSR) in Ti6Al4V titanium alloy. Moreover, the effects of RSR on fatigue properties and its mechanism were both revealed. Laser peening experiments were conducted at room temperature (RT-LP) and elevated temperature (300 °C-WLP). Then the yield strengths of specimens were obtained through tensile experiments and their improvement induced by WLP was analyzed by microstructures. A finite element analysis was used to research the effects of RT-LP and 300 °C-WLP on the RSR during fatigue. Finally, the fatigue life and fracture microstructures were both measured and analyzed. The results indicate that the severe plastic strain induced by 300 °C-WLP results in lots of crossed acicular $\alpha$ phases with a short spacing, which promotes the interactions between $\alpha$ phases and leads to an increasing dislocation density. Therefore, the yield strength of 300 °C-WLPed specimens is much greater than RT-LPed samples based on the Hall-Petch relations. Besides, the simulated results show that the extended yield strength of 300 °C-WLPed specimens significantly decreases the d$\sigma$/d$\epsilon$ during fatigue and thus reduces the relaxation of CRS. Moreover, it can be found that the fatigue life of 300 °C-WLPed specimens is subjected to an significant increase, which can be attributed to the increasing finished crack lengths and the decreasing RSR.},

abstract = {Residual stress is of great significance for the structural integrity of components and assemblies. Its proper evaluation and integration into failure criteria may considerably enhance the engineering parts performance. Although experimental measurements of residual stress provide important input, the crucial next step is the incorporation of the information obtained into numerical modelling. Eigenstrain method is a powerful way of specifying residual stress in structures in a self-consistent way that satisfies the mechanics requirements of stress equilibrium and strain compatibility. This approach also enables the verification of experimental data consistency. In combination with the principle of transferability of eigenstrain, it allows the application of well-characterised material processing conditions to different solid geometries with the purpose of predicting residual stress. In the present work, a novel user-friendly implementation framework is presented that is able to predict the residual stress fields arising due to material surface treatment of arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. In the first instance, detailed analysis of potential sources of error was conducted, followed by verification of the validity of the procedure conducted by analysing relevant cases from the literature: laser shock peening and carburising combined with quenching. The work presented here opens new ways to use the eigenstrain method for real industrial applications where the mechanical components geometry is generally complex. Particularly, it enables the integration of residual stress into well-established FEM fatigue prediction codes when the experimental data available is limited.},

abstract = {Fretting fatigue initiation behavior in Ti–6Al–4V dovetail assemblies are investigated by the combining applications of experimental and theoretical methods. The evolution of fretting regime, fretting wear mechanism and fretting crack initiation behavior in as-received and shot-peened samples are developed and comparatively evaluated. The effect of shot-peening on crack initiation orientation is elucidated through an analytical approach using fracture mechanic concepts. The results highlight that shot-peening not only changes the fretting wear mechanism and crack initiation angle, but also reduces the crack number and prevents the crack propagation in Ti–6Al–4V dovetail joint specimens.},

abstract = {The ABAQUS software was used to analyze the residual stress of TiN film treated by the single point micro-scale laser shock peening ({\&}mu;LSP). In view of the multi-factor effect of {\&}mu;LSP, the response surface methodology (RSM) of Design-Expert software was utilized to analyze the influence of laser process parameters on the residual stress in TiN film, based on the Box-Behnken experimental design methods, as a result, optimal combination of the laser process parameters was obtained. The results showed that {\&}mu;LSP can transform the tensile residual stress in the TiN film into the compressive residual stress, the compressive residual stress was gradually increasing with the increased laser power density, when the laser power density was 8 GW/cm {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, the maximum compressive residual stress of the film surface was up to -350.48 MPa. In addition, as the laser power density increased, the maximum compressive residual stress was moving away from the spot center. The optimal combination of the laser process parameters of {\&}mu;LSP was obtained by the RSM, the laser power density was 7.6 GW/cm2, laser spot diameter was 283 {\&}mu;m, and the number of shocking was 2 times. Simulation results of the average residual stress was -248.76 MPa, while the predicting result of regression model was -245.31 MPa, the error was just 1.38 {\%}. The results showed that {\&}mu;LSP was feasible for improving the residual stress distribution of TiN film, and the RSM can effectively optimize the process parameters of {\&}mu;LSP. {\&}copy; (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract = {Foreign object damage (FOD) can seriously shorten the fatigue lives of components. On the other hand, laser shock peening improves fatigue life by introducing deep compressive residual stress into components. In this paper we examine how the non-uniform steep residual stress profile arising from FOD of laser peened aerofoil leading edges varies as a function of fatigue crack growth under high cycle fatigue and mixed high and low cycle fatigue conditions. The ballistic FOD impacts were introduced by impacting a cube edge head-on (at an angle of 0°) to the leading edge. The residual stress distributions have been mapped by synchrotron X-ray diffraction prior to cracking and subsequent to short (∼1 mm) and long (up to 6 mm) crack growth. The results suggest that the local residual stress field is highly stable even to the growth of relatively long cracks.},

@article{LIU2007,
abstract = {Laser shock peening (LSP) is an innovative surface treatment method that can result in significant improvement in the fatigue life of many metallic components. The process produces very little or no surface profile modification while producing a considerably deeper compressive residual stress layer than traditional shot peening operations. The work discussed here was designed to: (a) quantify the fatigue life improvement achieved by LSP in a typical high strength aircraft aluminium alloy and (b) identify any technological risks associated with its use. It is shown that when LSP conditions are optimal for the material and specimen configuration, a 2014three to four times increase in fatigue life over the as-machined specimens could be achieved for a representative fighter aircraft loading spectrum when applied at a representative load level. However, if the process parameters are not optimal for the material investigated here, fatigue lives of LSP treated specimens may be reduced instead of increased due to the occurrence of internal cracking. This paper details the effect of laser power density on fatigue life of 7050-T7451 aluminium alloy by experimental and numerical analysis.},

abstract = {The contribution of the entire manufacturing chain to the final residual stress state cannot be neglected. In-between processes, the stress redistribution has to satisfy the equilibrium principle. An investigation was conducted on the manufacturing processes of gears. A convergent approach isolated the effects of the final production step. The processes' interaction is understood by a model of springs, into a self-equilibrated potential energy concept. The influence of early production stages is revealed as the residual stress integral along the depth range mostly subjected to relaxation. Named as Unstable Area of Residual Stress (UARS), it was verified between machining and heat treatment, and between shot peening and grinding. The interaction is relevant to the gear fatigue behavior. Failure mode and lifetime correspond to the depth where the interaction effects were mainly observed.},

abstract = {Various peening techniques are employed to prevent stress corrosion cracking or to extend the fatigue life of structures. In this study, to investigate the effect of shot peening on operation, an analysis method that predicts the stress distribution due to shot peening was proposed. Using the proposed method, the load distribution from the shot collisions was modeled, and it was integrated with a dynamic analysis method based on the idealized explicit FEM (IEFEM). The accuracy of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing the stress distribution from the collision of a single shot with the results analyzed using ABAQUS. A thermal elastic-plastic analysis method using IEFEM was applied to the analysis of the residual stress distribution of a multi-pass-welded pipe joint. The calculated residual stress distribution was compared with the measured residual stress distribution measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the two welding residual distributions were in good agreement. Considering the calculated welding residual stress distribution, the modification of the stress distribution due to shot peening was predicted using the proposed method. A similar stress distribution was obtained using XRD for the case where a large number of collisions were considered.},
